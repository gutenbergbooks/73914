<small>FIVE AND ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> Happy Six” grew out of “The Merry
Five,” and this was the way of it:—</p>

<p>The Merry Five, as you may remember,
were Molly, Kirke, and Weezy Rowe, and
their twin neighbors, Paul and Pauline Bradstreet;
and they lived in Silver Gate City,
in sunny California.</p>

<p>Well,—to go on with the story,—one May
morning before school-time, as Kirke was
amusing his little brother upon the veranda,
Molly came rushing out in great excitement,
crying,—</p>

<p>“O Kirke, you can’t guess what’s going
to happen to The Merry Five!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Kirke, engaged in attaching a string to
the neck of a speckled horned toad, answered
coolly without looking up,—</p>

<p>“No; and I never said I could. Fortune-telling
is not my trade.”</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> your trade, you funny boy?”
asked little Miss Weezy, suddenly appearing
from the garden.</p>

<p>“Just at present I am in the harness business,”
he returned, as he tied together the
ends of the cord.</p>

<p>Yellow-haired Donald, on his hands and
knees at his brother’s feet, watched the proceeding
with deep interest, for this toad was
to be his little pony.</p>

<p>“In the teasing business you mean, Kirke
Rowe,” retorted Molly, tossing back her long
auburn braid with some impatience. “You
want me to think you don’t care what happens
to The Merry Five.”</p>

<p>“Whisper it to <i>me</i>, Molly, please do!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
implored Weezy, her dainty sea-shell ear close
to her sister’s mouth. “I can keep a secret
all to myself.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a secret,” cried Molly, waltzing
the child down the veranda. “It’s not a
secret, but Kirke needn’t listen.” And she
chanted gayly at the top of her voice,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“We’re going to Europe, to Europe, to Europe,</div>
<div class="verse">The Merry Five are going to Europe!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>This aroused Kirke.</p>

<p>“Molly Rowe, what do you mean?” he
cried, nearly letting the toad escape, harness
and all. “Who said such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Bradstreet is going, anyway.
There’s some trouble in Paris about one of his
vessels: he’s obliged to go in June.”</p>

<p>“But what has that to do with us, I’d like
to inquire?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing at all! Only we’re
going with him; that is, I almost know we
are. The doctor said yesterday that papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
needed a sea voyage, and mud-baths, and
things. And mamma said just now, ‘Yes,
Edward, you ought to go to Europe.’ And
when mamma says that”—</p>

<p>“I declare, Molly Rowe, it does look like
it! June, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Is it far to Europe?” asked Weezy anxiously;
“farther than Mexico?”</p>

<p>“Farther than Mexico? Why, you little
goosie, Mexico is within sight of us, and Europe
is ’way off to the other side of the world.”</p>

<p>“Truly? Then I’m not going to any old
Europe!”</p>

<p>And Weezy’s lip began to quiver.</p>

<p>“Not with papa and mamma, darling?” said
Molly. “They’ll go with us and so will Captain
Bradstreet, and they’ll all take care of
The Merry Five.”</p>

<p>“Here’s three cheers for Europe!” shouted
Kirke, swinging his cap. “And hurrah! Three
cheers for The Merry Five!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Hurrah! <i>Free chairs for Mary Five!</i>”
echoed little Donald, flapping his arms like
a windmill in a gale. “Hurrah! Free chairs
for Mary Five!”</p>

<p>It was so droll to hear him that his listeners
all laughed: and who can wonder?</p>

<p>“Bravo, Don!” roared Kirke, tossing the
little cheerer over his shoulder. “If your
<i>Mary Five</i> wants <i>free chairs</i> she ought to
have ’em!”</p>

<p>“So I say,” said Molly, drying her eyes.
“And a little boy that can shout for her like
that deserves a reserved seat!”</p>

<p>“Let’s give him one—a reserved seat in
our club,” returned Kirke good-naturedly.
“He ought to come into The Merry Five.”</p>

<p>“Only with him, you see, we shouldn’t be
The Merry Five any longer,” demurred Molly;
“there’d be one to carry.”</p>

<p>“Then we might call ourselves The Merry
<i>Six</i>: how is that?” amended Kirke, setting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
Donald down again. “What do you say to
The Merry Six?”</p>

<p>“The Merry Half Dozen would be nicer,
<i>I</i> think,” put in Weezy; “a great deal nicer.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Weezy,” retorted Kirke, “that
sounds like a nestful of eggs! Let’s have it
The Merry Six.”</p>

<p>“Why not The <i>Happy</i> Six?” asked Molly,
with a roguish smile. “Let’s be happy now,
just for a change.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, Molly, I’m willing, if Paul and
Pauline are.”</p>

<p>“So am I, too,” assented Miss Weezy,
though secretly preferring a half-dozen to
six.</p>

<p>Paul was just now away on a visit, but
when they proposed the question to Pauline
that afternoon, she received “little Number
Six” into the club with open arms, and declared
that his extreme youth was no objection
whatever. She had heard that as people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
grow older, they always approve of having
young members come into their clubs. She
was sure Paul would welcome Master Donald
cordially, and would agree with them all that
the new name proposed by Molly was exactly
the thing.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Donald and his
“Mary Five” became straightway “The
Happy Six;” and this is a true account of
the transaction; though, to be sure, it had
not been settled yet that the club was going
to Europe.</p>

<p>“But what difference does that make?”
asked Pauline. “Can’t we be The Happy
Six, all the same, wherever we are? I move
that we try to be happy right here in California
till the middle of June, anyway, and
then”—</p>

<p>“I second the move,” responded Molly.</p>

<p>“’Tis a vote,” cried Kirke and little Number
Six in chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>And now, in the chapters that follow, you
will hear more of this new brother-and-sisterhood,
and will learn of its whereabouts and
all its proceedings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>SHOT AND SING WUNG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> the Rowes should decide to go
to Europe or not, the Bradstreets were going;
and Captain Bradstreet thought it high
time to inform Paul of the plan. The boy
had not been well for some days, and for
change of air had been sent to the ranch of
Mr. Keith, a relative, who had a warm regard
for himself and his sister Pauline.</p>

<p>“Kirke,” said the captain, driving up that
afternoon after school, “I’m going out to
Mr. Keith’s to see Paul. Would you like to
go with me?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you, Captain Bradstreet,
I’ll be ready in a second,” cried
Kirke, rushing for his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>The spirited horse had been reined up to
the hedge, where he pawed and champed
the bit, till his passenger appeared and
vaulted headlong into the phaeton.</p>

<p>In his haste, Kirke had forgotten to tie
Shot, the fox-terrier, into his kennel.</p>

<p>“Weezy, Weezy,” he called over his shoulder,
as the carriage started. “Look out for
Shot, please, Weezy; don’t let him follow us.”</p>

<p>“I won’t let him,” said Weezy; “I’ll keep
him.” And she drew him into the house
and closed the door.</p>

<p>Having done this, she went back upon the
veranda to finish her sewing. She was making
a golf cape for her pet doll to wear at
sea; and the work proved so absorbing that
she failed to notice what Donald was doing.
Before she knew it, the child had opened
the front door, and run into the hall; and at
the same time Shot had run out, and gone
tearing after the phaeton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Kirke looked rather crestfallen when the
little animal came barking about the wheels.</p>

<p>“There’s that dog, after all. I didn’t
mean he should come.”</p>

<p>“Send him home, then,” suggested the
captain. “Why don’t you send him home,
Kirke?”</p>

<p>“Because he wouldn’t go,” answered the
lad, in laughing confusion. “He wouldn’t
go, and I should only hurt his feelings for
nothing.”</p>

<p>The ruddy-faced captain suppressed a
smile, and listened patiently, while Kirke
proceeded to sing the praises of the graceful
white terrier, who would not obey his
master.</p>

<p>“He loves me tremendously; he can’t bear
to stay away from me: there’s the trouble.”</p>

<p>And in truth a more affectionate dog than
little Shot never lived. He was a general
favorite, which certainly could not have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
said of Zip, Donald’s Mexican cur that had
died the preceding autumn.</p>

<p>As the phaeton whirled along, Shot darted
first to one side of the road and then to the
other, to chase squirrels and gophers into
their holes, but without once losing sight of
his beloved owner.</p>

<p>“I suppose, Kirke, you’re very fond of the
little rascal,” observed the captain, as they
drew near the end of their drive.</p>

<p>“You’d better believe I am, Captain Bradstreet.
I wouldn’t part with him for a farm.”</p>

<p>“The lad’s in sober earnest,” thought the
gentleman, peering from beneath his white
eyebrows at Kirke’s animated face. “I never
knew a boy more devoted to his friends.”</p>

<p>They were now spinning along the winding
avenue leading to Mr. Keith’s house. At
their right was a green lawn, bordered with
orange-trees; on their left, a thrifty olive-orchard,
in which a Chinaman was plowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“They’re always plowing somewhere,” commented
the captain. “I understand the soil
has to be turned over pretty often to keep
it light and moist.”</p>

<p>“And it has to be irrigated, too, doesn’t
it?” asked Kirke, watching Shot, skipping
nimbly across the field toward the mule-team.</p>

<p>“Irrigated? Oh, yes. But there’s not
water enough at present to do the thing
thoroughly, and that is why Mr. Keith is
having a new well dug over yonder.”</p>

<p>“I see it,” said Kirke, glancing in the
direction indicated by the captain; “and he
has got the curb up already.”</p>

<p>“So he has. Ah, here comes Paul. I”—</p>

<p>The sentence was cut short by a prolonged
howl from Shot. The confiding little creature
had ventured too near the Chinaman’s heels,
and Sing Wung, suspecting him of evil intentions,
had driven him away by a vigorous kick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“The old wretch!” cried Kirke, springing
over the carriage-wheel. “He’s been abusing
my poor little Shot!”</p>

<p>And as the yelping dog ran up to him for
protection, Kirke soothed him as he would
have soothed a baby.</p>

<p>Before Captain Bradstreet could hitch his
horse to the post under the pepper-tree, Paul
was beside him, his face aglow with pleasure
as well as with sunburn. The sunburn
caused him to look more than ever like his
father. Each had large, frank, blue eyes
and a ruddy complexion; but while the captain’s
hair was snow-white, his son’s was
flaxen, or, as Pauline would have it, “a light
<i>écru</i>.”</p>

<p>“How are you, Paul? How are you, my
dear boy? Better, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, papa, ever so much better, thank
you. But why haven’t you come before?
I’ve looked for you and looked for you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>Paul spoke with feeling. He and Pauline,
though now fifteen years of age, were not
ashamed to show their love for their father.
The affection existing between Captain Bradstreet
and his motherless twins was something
beautiful to behold.</p>

<p>Kirke was surprised to see how coolly
Paul received the news of the proposed trip
to Europe. Though greatly pleased, he was
by no means as excited as Kirke had been
that morning when the plan was first mentioned.
Paul was a quieter sort of boy than
Kirke, and two years older. Moreover, he
had already been to sea several times, and
the novelty was pretty well worn off. Still,
he wished to go again very much, especially
if the Rowes would go, too, for “that would
make it a good deal jollier.”</p>

<p>After chatting awhile, Captain Bradstreet
went into the lemon-house to speak with his
cousin, Mr. Keith, leaving the boys to entertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
each other. Paul, acting as host, at once
invited Kirke to visit the well that had been
begun; and they sauntered by the lemon-grove
to a deep hole sunk in the ground.
Above the hole stood a windlass with a
bucket attached to it.</p>

<p>“Is anybody down there now?” asked
Kirke, dropping upon his knees and peering
into the dark cavern.</p>

<p>“No, Yeck Wo is sick to-day; so Sing
Wung left off working here, and is cultivating
in the orchard.”</p>

<p>“So it takes two to run this thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Sing Wung stays below to shovel
earth into the bucket, and Yeck Wo stays up
here to turn the windlass and draw the
bucket up into daylight.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Kirke, “and the Wo fellow
tips the earth out of the bucket on to this
heap here, then sends the bucket back empty.
It must be fun to watch him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“It’ll be more fun, though, when they strike
hard pan, for then they’ll begin to blast.”</p>

<p>It was not Paul who said this, but Mr.
Keith. He and Captain Bradstreet had now
joined the boys and were standing with them
near the well. “When they begin to blast,
Kirke, you must come down here and make
us a little visit,” added Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>Kirke accepted the invitation eagerly, for,
like most boys of thirteen, he revelled in the
explosion of gunpowder.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, can’t you come Saturday, bright
and early? I’ve promised to let Sing Wung
go home Friday, and Paul will drive out for
him Saturday morning, and could bring you
back with him as well as not.”</p>

<p>“O Mr. Keith, I <i>hope</i> I can come,” said
Kirke joyously, as he and the captain took
their departure.</p>

<p>But in repassing the olive-orchard the
youth’s happy face clouded. In the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
he caught a glimpse of Sing Wung in the
very act of flinging a stone at little Shot,
who, forgetful of the recent repulse, had
frisked again into his neighborhood.</p>

<p>“If that old Chinaman wasn’t so far off I’d
give him ‘Hail Columbia!’” muttered he.
“Mean creature! Wouldn’t I like to dump
him into that new well?”</p>

<p>“No; you certainly wouldn’t,” said the captain
with an indulgent smile. “On the contrary,
I’ll wager that if he should fall in,
you’d be the first to help pull him out.”</p>

<p>Kirke was indignantly protesting that he
“should do no such thing,” when suddenly the
horse, Pizarro, stumbled upon a rolling stone
and turned a half-somersault down the hill.</p>

<p>In an instant Captain Bradstreet and Kirke
had leaped to the ground.</p>

<p>“Sit upon his head, Kirke,” ordered the
captain. “So long as his head is kept down
he can’t flounder about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Kirke did as he was told, and while he was
perched upon Pizarro’s broad cheek, Captain
Bradstreet unbuckled the harness and detached
it from the phaeton.</p>

<p>“The thill is broken, isn’t it?” asked Kirke.</p>

<p>“Yes, broken almost in two.”</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet firmly grasped the
horse’s bridle. “Now jump, Kirke, and be
quick about it.”</p>

<p>Kirke promptly obeyed, and Pizarro straightway
struggled to his feet, looking very much
ashamed.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to be injured anywhere,”
said the captain, after carefully feeling the
horse’s limbs. “I wish the same could be
said of the phaeton. Have you a string
about you, Kirke, to splice that shaft with?”</p>

<p>For a wonder Kirke’s pocket to-day did
not boast of even so much as a fishing-line.</p>

<p>“I might run to the next ranch and beg a
bit of rope,” he suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“Wait a moment, my boy, here comes a
greaser. Let’s see what he can do for us.”</p>

<p>A “greaser” is the common name for a
Mexican Indian.</p>

<p>“What an ugly, stupid-looking fellow,”
thought Kirke; “I don’t believe he knows a
string from a rattlesnake.”</p>

<p>But, unpromising as he appeared, the Indian
understood a little English, and, on being
offered a silver quarter, uncoiled from his
neck a long, narrow strip of deerskin, and
with it tied together the splintered ends of
the thill.</p>

<p>“The greasers use those strips of deerhide
when they tote bundles on their backs,” explained
the captain, when they were again on
their way. “He has spliced the shaft pretty
firmly, Kirke, but it may draw apart. You’d
better keep close watch of it.”</p>

<p>The damaged thill was the one on Kirke’s
side of the phaeton, and for the rest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
drive he felt such a responsibility about it
that he forgot everything else; he even forgot
his beloved little terrier.</p>

<p>They were entering the city before he noticed
that Shot was nowhere in sight. Then
he remembered that he had not seen him
since leaving Mr. Keith’s ranch.</p>

<p>“Now I think of it, I haven’t seen him
either,” said Captain Bradstreet. “Maybe
the little scamp took a notion to stay with
Paul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Captain Bradstreet, that wouldn’t
be a bit like Shot!” exclaimed Kirke vehemently.
“Don’t you know how he’s always
tagging after me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, like a dory after a pilot boat,” said
the captain, smiling.</p>

<p>“Where can he be, I wonder? Do you
suppose—you <i>don’t</i> suppose—that hateful
Chinaman can have lamed him or anything?”</p>

<p>Kirke looked so extremely troubled that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the tender-hearted captain hastened to reply,
“No, indeed! I don’t suppose anything of
the kind. More likely Shot has picked a
quarrel with a gopher and is bound to have
the last word. If he’s not at home by sunrise
we’ll ride back to the ranch to look him up.”</p>

<p>He fully expected to hear the dog’s merry
bark at any moment, and was quite disturbed
the next morning when Kirke ran
over to tell him that the little terrier was
still missing.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, we’ll soon find him,” he
said; and immediately telephoned for the
horse and surrey.</p>

<p>But when he and Kirke reached the ranch
Shot was not there, nor had he been there
since the previous afternoon. “The very
last I saw of him, Sing Wung was shying
a stone at him,” said Paul. “He hates dogs,
that Chinaman does. I believe he’s afraid
of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“He couldn’t have been afraid of my dear
little innocent terrier,” exclaimed Kirke
savagely; “he stoned him just for meanness.”</p>

<p>On being interviewed, Sing Wung protested
that the dog had followed the carriage,
and that was all he knew about him.
But he spoke in such a hesitating way that
Kirke was sure he kept back the truth. The
lad was passing through a fiery ordeal and
his heart was hot within him. “If ever I
saw lies I saw ’em to-day in those slanting
eyes behind us,” he said in Paul’s ear as
they turned away from the suspected Celestial.
“I feel just as if he had killed poor
little Shot and pitched him into the cañon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wouldn’t do that, Kirke; ’twould
take too much courage—Sing Wung is a
chicken-hearted creature.”</p>

<p>“Not too chicken-hearted to stone my dog,
though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Paul could not gainsay this, but as he
bade Kirke good-by, he remarked cheerily,—</p>

<p>“I half believe you’ll find Shot at home
waiting for you. I shall know Saturday
morning. Remember I’m coming for you
Saturday morning at six o’clock, sharp.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>WHO WAS THE THIEF?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Paul</span> called for Kirke on the following
Saturday, long before breakfast-time. He
had driven in from the ranch in Mr. Keith’s
two-seated wagon, drawn by a pair of little
brown mules, and was evidently in a prodigious
hurry.</p>

<p>“Hello, Selkirk!” he shouted to the side
of the house. “Stir around lively. Mr.
Keith wants Sing Wung to get to work on
the well early.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there in two seconds,” returned
Kirke, thrusting a tumbled head through an
open window. “All dressed but my hair.”</p>

<p>“Good! Can’t you eat your breakfast on
the road?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“To be sure. I can eat anywhere, everywhere.”</p>

<p>The tumbled head disappeared; and Paul
began to munch a buttered roll just brought
him by his sister Pauline. Their home was
just across the street, and she had watched
for Paul, and rushed out to meet him, and
now stood leaning against the front wheel of
the wagon, chatting with him. She was a
warm-hearted, impulsive girl, rather too heedless
and outspoken at times. She had no
mother to guide her, and lacked the gentle
manners of her friend, Molly Rowe.</p>

<p>“You ought to put on your hat, Polly.
You’re getting as brown as a Mexican,” remarked
Paul, with brotherly frankness, as he
attacked a second roll.</p>

<p>“Black, you should say,” corrected she
coolly. “I’ve noticed it myself. You’re an
albino. I’m a negress. I’ve no manner of doubt
people call us ‘the black and white twins.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“What about Shot, Paul? Has he been
heard from?” called Molly from behind the
window-shade of her chamber.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hoped he had turned up by this
time. No, we haven’t seen a sign of him,
Molly; but we’ve found this.”</p>

<p>Here Paul held up a dog’s collar.</p>

<p>“Shot’s collar!” cried Molly.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’ve found that
and haven’t found the dog?” exclaimed
Kirke, rushing down the steps of the veranda,
flourishing in one hand a gripsack,
in the other a small bunch of bananas.
“Where did you find it, Paul? And when?”</p>

<p>“Last night, Kirke, in the hedge of the
olive-orchard.”</p>

<p>“In the hedge?”</p>

<p>“Yes, tucked under it, ’way out of sight.”</p>

<p>“Then somebody hid it there—Sing
Wung! I’ll bet ’twas Sing Wung!” muttered
Kirke, as he mounted the wagon. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
killed Shot. Got mad with him and killed
him, and then saved his collar. He thought
he could get money for it.”</p>

<p>“Has somebody killed Shot?” piped half-dressed
Weezy, screening herself from view
behind her sister. “Oh, dear, dear! Poor
little Shot!”</p>

<p>“Deah, deah, poo’ ’ittle S’ot!” echoed
Don, running to the casement in his ruffled
white night-dress, and standing there quite
unabashed.</p>

<p>“Such a sweet, lovely little dog as he
was!” went on Weezy, in a tearful voice.
“Just as white and good as he could be.
S’pose he’s got up to heaven yet, Kirke?”</p>

<p>“The idea, Weezy!” Kirke’s tone was at
once grieved and scornful. “Who ever heard
of a fox-terrier’s going to heaven?”</p>

<p>“Don’t good little fox-terriers go to
heaven? Nobody ever told me that before,”
sighed Weezy, as Paul turned the mules<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
toward Chinatown. “O Kirke, don’t you
wish Shot had been a good little skye-terrier
’stead of a fox? He would have gone to
heaven <i>then</i>, you know!”</p>

<p>“It’s no sign Shot is dead, Weezy, dear,
because he just happened to lose his collar,”
cried Pauline, stepping back from the wheel
with a smothered laugh. “He’ll come trotting
home, wagging his tail, one of these
days, you’ll see!”</p>

<p>It was like Pauline to prophesy pleasant
things. She was always hopeful, always
cheerful. They called her the merriest member
of The Happy Six.</p>

<p>“Yes, Polly, and you’ll see, too,” was
Kirke’s gloomy rejoinder. “Good-by, everybody.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Sobersides,” retorted Pauline,
brushing her sleeves, which had rested upon
the dusty tire. “Good-by, Twinny, love, I’ll be
happy to meet you later in Europe, both of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Kirke hardly smiled at this nonsensical
farewell. He cared very little just now about
Europe, or any other foreign country. He
could only think of Shot’s collar found in
the hedge. Somebody had hidden it there;
and in his heart Kirke convicted Sing Wung.</p>

<p>“That collar was expensive, you know,
Paul,” he broke forth, before they had
reached the first corner. “He was going to
sell it at one of the second-hand stores.”</p>

<p>“How could he have sold it? That would
have given him away, Kirke. Shot’s name
is on it.”</p>

<p>“Poh! couldn’t the villain have ripped off
that plate?”</p>

<p>“Not very easily. Besides, Kirke, if Sing
Wung really meant to sell the collar, why
didn’t he carry it home with him yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he couldn’t screw his courage up.
He might have been afraid of getting caught
taking it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Though by nature unsuspicious, Kirke was
a boy of strong prejudices. Since making
up his mind that the Chinaman was guilty of
a crime, he could no longer tolerate him.</p>

<p>“But how are we going to prove that Sing
Wung put the collar in the hedge?” asked
Paul earnestly. “Mr. Keith says it isn’t fair
to condemn <i>anybody</i> on circumstantial evidence.”</p>

<p>“Fudge! What more evidence does he
want? Didn’t we both see Sing Wung stoning
my Shot? And has anybody set eyes on
my Shot from that day to this?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Paul, “it does look dark against
Sing Wung, I confess, and I’m just as mad with
him as you are.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think Mr. Keith would keep
such a sneak. He ought to discharge him,
and I’ve a great mind to tell him so,” returned
Kirke, as if his opinion and advice would carry
great weight with that gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Oh, he can’t discharge him now, Kirke!
How can he, right in the height of the barley
harvest?”</p>

<p>“He can hire somebody else.”</p>

<p>“No, he can’t for love or money. The
Mexicans and Chinamen are all engaged for
the season by this time. Besides, there’s the
well not half done.”</p>

<p>Kirke bit his lip. He knew that this well
was needed at once. He had seen for himself
how Mr. Keith’s young orange-trees were
turning yellow for want of proper irrigation.
As they approached the Chinese quarter of
the city, he broke the silence by remarking
grimly,—</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t speak to Sing Wung. I want
him to know I suspect him.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he’ll take the <i>cue</i>?” asked
Paul, attempting his sister’s trick of punning.</p>

<p>Sing Wung was waiting for them at the door
of his whitewashed cabin. He was dressed as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
usual in loose blue trousers and a frock of
lighter blue denim, his long cue wound about
his head in a coil and tied with narrow, indigo-colored
ribbon.</p>

<p>“He has the blues awfully, hasn’t he?”
whispered Kirke, not to be outdone by Paul in
the play upon words.</p>

<p>“One of his relatives must have died,” was
Paul’s low answer as he drew in the reins.
“I’ve heard that the Chinese wear blue ribbon
on their hair for mourning.”</p>

<p>“If he’s mourning for my dog, it looks well
in him,” mused Shot’s bereaved master; and
to emphasize his indignation Kirke turned
away his head while Sing Wung climbed to
the back seat of the wagon.</p>

<p>Paul cracked the whip, and the grotesque
little mules trotted on, flapping their broad
ears at every step, as if they considered them
wings and were preparing to fly.</p>

<p>“The grass is getting brown,” remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Paul, when they had left the city behind them,
“as brown as hay. And phew! isn’t the road
dusty!”</p>

<p>“Sneezing dusty,” answered Kirke; “I don’t
believe the people that live in that shanty over
yonder have to spend any money for snuff.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to a wretched hut
a little removed from the highway, and entirely
surrounded by dirt.</p>

<p>“Mateo lives there,” said Paul carelessly.</p>

<p>“Who’s Mateo?”</p>

<p>“Mateo? Oh, he’s a lazy, no-account Indian,
who helps sometimes on the ranch.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he isn’t the fellow that mended
our thill for us the other day?” mused Kirke.
“We broke down somewhere near here. How
does he look? Is he fat?”</p>

<p>“Fat as butter. He ought to be, you
know, considering they call him a <i>greaser</i>.”</p>

<p>Kirke giggled, and Paul looked highly gratified
at the success of his witticism. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
thought he might get up quite a reputation
as a humorist, if Pauline didn’t always say
the funny things before he had a chance.
He was glad to feel that he was entertaining
Kirke: he couldn’t bear to see the boy so
downhearted.</p>

<p>The mules were frisky that morning, and
reached the end of the journey in excellent
season.</p>

<p>“Heap soon!” grinned Sing Wung, as he
alighted upon the ground, apparently not at
all disturbed because Kirke had taken no
notice of him whatever.</p>

<p>“Oh, you can laugh, can you?” thought
Kirke, hopping down over the opposite wheel.
“You ought to be howling, you dog-murderer!”</p>

<p>“You’re early, Sing Wung,” said Mr. Keith,
who had come out to shake hands with the
boys. “You’ve got ahead of Yeck Wo.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t Yeck Wo come yet?” asked Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
quickly. “You don’t suppose the man is
sick again, do you, Mr. Keith?”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to fear it, Paul.”</p>

<p>“If he is, what’s to be done, Mr. Keith?”</p>

<p>Paul still stood by the wagon, reins in
hand. He was very much interested in the
progress of the well, and wanted the digging
to go on, since Kirke had come on purpose
to watch it.</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t I go for Mateo, Mr. Keith?”</p>

<p>“No, Paul, thank you, not quite yet. I
don’t want Mateo as long as there’s any hope
of Yeck Wo. But if Yeck Wo doesn’t come,
I may ask you later to go for Mateo. We’ll
tie the mules here under the pepper-tree to
have them handy.”</p>

<p>“No workee?” asked Sing Wung, not quite
understanding what was said.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Sing Wung, you can go right
to work here,” said Mr. Keith, leading the
way to the new well. “Come boys, please,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
and help me lower him down in the bucket.
He must go to digging.”</p>

<p>The boys sprang forward with alacrity, feeling
that now the fun had fairly begun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>KIRKE’S BRAVE DEED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Swinging</span> his limber arms, the little blue
clad Chinaman scuffed behind Mr. Keith and
the boys to the mouth of the unfinished well.
Over this stood the temporary windlass, its
huge bucket swaying to and fro above the
dizzy hollow.</p>

<p>Kirke noticed that this hollow was deeper
than when he had seen it last, and the mound
of loose earth near it was considerably higher.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith and the two boys held the crank
of the windlass with an iron grip while Sing
Wung stepped inside the bucket; then turning
the handle slowly backward, they lowered
him deeper and deeper till he had reached
the bottom of the dim-yawning cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“I told Captain Bradstreet I’d like to
dump Sing Wung into this well, and I’ve
done it,” said Kirke aside to Paul.</p>

<p>“The slant-eyed old villain doesn’t weigh
much more than your little Shot,” responded
Paul, bending over the dusky abyss.</p>

<p>By this time the Chinaman had scrambled
out of his novel elevator and was throwing
into it great spadefuls of dirt.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith looked at his watch. “I begin
to think Yeck Wo isn’t coming. If he lived
anywhere near, I’d send to inquire.”</p>

<p>At that moment Sing Wung piped shrilly
from beneath their feet.</p>

<p>“Heap muchee! Pullee! Pullee!”</p>

<p>Kirke sprang to the windlass, crying,
“Lend a hand, Paul. You and I together
can hoist the bucket.”</p>

<p>“You’re very kind, boys,” said Mr. Keith
gratefully, as he assisted them in emptying
the dirt. “We’ll take turns at this business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
for a little while, if you’re willing. Yeck
Wo may soon be here. He’s worth two
Mateos.”</p>

<p>For a half hour the work went on briskly,
Sing Wung in the depths below filling the
bucket, and Mr. Keith and his young aids
above ground hauling it to the surface and
there dumping its contents.</p>

<p>Then suddenly was heard a sharp, metallic
sound,—the scraping of the Chinaman’s
spade against a rock.</p>

<p>“He’s struck hard pan,” shouted the excited
lads in a breath. “Hurrah! Hurrah!
Sing Wung has struck hard pan.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, boys, I believe you’re
right,” cried Mr. Keith, hardly less excited
than they. “Next thing we may come to
water.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to blast now, Mr. Keith?
Shall I bring you the drills and hammer?”
asked Paul eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Yes, Paul, if you please, and a stick of
giant powder and the caps and that coil of
fuse.”</p>

<p>After these articles had been dropped into
the well, Sing Wung began the process of
drilling, using the shortest drill first, and
longer and longer ones as he pierced farther
and farther into the hard pan. He worked
quickly, turning the pointed steel instrument
a little with his left hand each time he struck
its blunt top with the hammer.</p>

<p>Having assured himself of the Chinaman’s
skill, Mr. Keith soon shouted to him, “Call
me as soon as the hole is three feet deep,”
and followed by the boys walked away for a
drink of cool water from the Mexican <i>olla</i>
on the veranda.</p>

<p>“It will take the man two hours at the
least,” he remarked, as he reached for the
gourd, “and perhaps half a day. There is
nothing yet for Mateo to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>In about two hours and a half they were
summoned by the sharp voice of Sing Wung.
He had finished the drilling and awaited
further instructions.</p>

<p>“The next thing to do, Sing Wung, is to
fit one of those percussion caps to the end
of the fuse,” cried Mr. Keith, when he had
reached the surface of the well.</p>

<p>“Yah!” growled Sing Wung, like an imprisoned
bear beneath.</p>

<p>“Well, now tie the fuse into the paper
wrapped around the stick of powder. Do
you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yah!” louder than before.</p>

<p>“A half stick of the giant powder will be
enough. Then drop the powder, cap, and fuse
into the hole, and press down with a lot of
dry earth. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“No tellee! Makee holee all samee,” muttered
the Chinaman sulkily. Had he not
blasted hard pan before?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Then cut off the fuse about four feet
from the hole, Sing Wung.”</p>

<p>They heard the Chinaman yawn noisily, as
if to say, “Melican man muchee talkee”;
but Mr. Keith continued, undaunted,—</p>

<p>“And when everything is ready, Sing
Wung, set fire to the end of the fuse and
jump into the bucket. We’ll pull you up in
a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Allee yight!”</p>

<p>Sing Wung understood perfectly. He was
already cutting in two a stick of giant powder.
In a short time he had buried this, as directed,
lighted the fuse, and been drawn up
out of the well.</p>

<p>The four ran to a safe distance, and two
minutes later came a loud explosion. Sing
Wung, after the dust and smoke had cleared
away, was again let down to his work. He
carried in his arms a can of black gunpowder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“If Mateo were here to lower me, I’d go
down myself to see the size of the chamber
made in the rock,” said Mr. Keith. “I don’t
know about trusting Sing Wung’s judgment
in regard to the amount of powder to use.”</p>

<p>“Kirke and I can let you down, Mr.
Keith,” volunteered Paul promptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” rejoined Kirke. “I can lift
as much as Paul can.”</p>

<p>“I know you’re strong for your age, Kirke,
but I weigh over two hundred pounds. I’m
afraid you boys might let me down in too
great a hurry.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Mr. Keith, we’ll promise not to
drop you.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, after the gentleman, against
his better judgment, had been prevailed upon
to enter the bucket, he looked so overgrown
in it—like an oak-tree in a tub—that the boys
could hardly manage the windlass for laughing.</p>

<p>Landed at last in safety upon the bed-rock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Mr. Keith found that the hole drilled by the
Chinaman had been enlarged by the giant
powder to the size of a great kettle. Into
this hole he poured about four quarts of
black gunpowder and inserted the end of a
fresh fuse. Finally he filled the rest of the
cavity with fine dry earth and “tamped” this
down very firmly.</p>

<p>“I’ve put in a heavy charge, Sing Wung,”
he said, as he turned from the man and
stepped back into the bucket. “After you’ve
lighted the fuse, you must run for your life.
You mustn’t go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“All yightee, no sleepee!” responded the
Chinaman, who, notwithstanding his oblique
eyes, could sometimes see a joke.</p>

<p>“The Chinese ought to understand gunpowder,
considering that they invented it,”
remarked Mr. Keith, as he emerged into the
upper air. “I hope I sha’n’t have to go
underground again to teach Sing Wung.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>The boys secretly echoed this hope, having
found their host’s weight a severe strain
to their muscles.</p>

<p>That this weight had been also a severe
strain upon the rope—not a new one—had
not occurred to them or to Mr. Keith, or,
indeed, to Sing Wung himself.</p>

<p>“It is evident that Yeck Wo is not coming,”
said Mr. Keith again, consulting his watch.
“After this next explosion there will be a
great deal of hard pan to be hoisted out, and
we must have Mateo to help us. If you’ll
bring him, Paul, I’ll be much obliged.”</p>

<p>Paul went, and was away some time. Before
his return Sing Wung had finished drilling
the hole in the rock and begun to put in
the charge. Mr. Keith and Kirke had let the
bucket down to the bottom of the well and
stood ready to turn the windlass at a second’s
notice.</p>

<p>Suddenly a faint light glimmered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
darkness below, and the Chinaman leaped into
the bucket yelling,—</p>

<p>“Pullee! Pullee!”</p>

<p>He had just ignited the fuse, and as the
flame crept slowly along its tube the gunpowder
interwoven in its fibres gave out a quick succession
of snapping sounds.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Sing Wung, we’ll pull you out
in no time!” Mr. Keith shouted back; and he
and Kirke turned the crank with a will.</p>

<p>But, alas! at the second revolution of the
windlass the rope broke, dropping the bucket
and its living freight back into the well!</p>

<p>Half-crazed by the accident, Sing Wung
struggled to his knees with a piercing cry,
and glared at the fire which drew every moment
nearer, hissing and crackling.</p>

<p>“Step on it! Put it out, man! Quick,
quick! are you crazy?” shrieked Mr. Keith,
leaning down into the well at the risk of losing
his balance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The unfortunate wretch was so paralyzed
with fright that he seemed powerless to obey.
He could only cower upon the rocks below,
muttering and mumbling.</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Kirke, he’ll be blown to
inch-pieces! Where are his wits?” ejaculated
Mr. Keith, rushing to the porch for the olla
in the frantic hope of quenching the spark
with water. To his dismay the jar was empty.</p>

<p>Kirke, left to his own devices, roared to
Sing Wung, “Try to catch hold of the rope!
Hang on to it! I’ll draw you up!”</p>

<p>But the frenzied creature never raised his
eyes from that fascinating spark creeping,
creeping toward the little mine of powder.</p>

<p>“Thunder and lightning, what ails him?
I must save him if I can,” thought Kirke,
hastily making fast the windlass by tying down
the handle.</p>

<p>Never pausing to consider the risk he was
taking, he grasped the dangling rope and slid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
down upon it, hand over hand, toward the burning
fuse. Should he be in season to smother
it? Ah, that was the question.</p>

<p>When he sprang from the end of the rope
to a foothold upon the rock beside Sing Wung,
the advancing flame was scarcely a finger’s
length from the buried powder. Even then
help might be too late.</p>

<p>With his heart in his throat, the lad dashed
forward and planted his foot upon the spark.
Oh, joy! it was soon extinguished! He had
saved the life of Sing Wung!</p>

<p>Little cared Kirke at that moment for dizzy
head or blistered hands. Even his late hatred
of the suspected Chinaman was quite over-weighed
by the intense satisfaction of having
been the means of his rescue.</p>

<p>How Sing Wung, speedily rallying from
his nervous shock, deftly spliced the severed
rope; and how he and his deliverer, one after
the other, were lifted from their gloomy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
quarters, will always remain to Kirke Rowe
a blurred memory, for he had hardly returned
to the sunlight before he fainted.</p>

<p>A dash of cold water restored him to consciousness,
and he opened his eyes to find
himself extended full length upon the lawn,
and Mr. Keith and Paul bending anxiously
over him. There were tears in both pairs of
eyes, and Mr. Keith was saying in broken
tones,—</p>

<p>“God bless the noble boy!”</p>

<p>And what more did Kirke see? What was
that white object nestling lovingly against his
breast, now lapping his cold cheek, now
barking for joy? Was it,—he could hardly
believe his own senses,—yes, surely, that
was Shot, his dear lamented terrier!</p>

<p>“Why, Shot, you blessed good little dog,
where have you been?” he exclaimed, starting
up, all alive with happiness. “Why,
Shot, where have you been?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“He go heap far! Indian sabe!” said Sing
Wung, who was squatting on his heels at
Kirke’s feet, and had been fanning him with
a green palm leaf.</p>

<p>“Indian? What Indian?”</p>

<p>“He means Mateo,” interposed Paul.
“<i>Mateo</i> was the thief; he stole Shot, and
now he pretends he didn’t. He tries to
make it out that Shot strayed to his house,
and that he tied him there to keep him safe
for his master.”</p>

<p>“Keep him safe! As if my bright little
dog wouldn’t have known enough to go
home, if he had let him alone! I don’t believe
one word of that old Indian’s story.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said Paul. “We all know
better, and we told him so. See how his
rope has worn the hair from Shot’s neck.”</p>

<p>“What a shame! But there, I won’t fret.
I have my little terrier back again, alive and
well,” murmured happy Kirke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>But he felt a pang of remorse, as he
looked at Sing Wung, and met that Chinaman’s
eyes fixed upon him with a glance of
the deepest devotion.</p>

<p>“Melican boy muchee good,” said the poor
fellow, brokenly. “No makee fizzee, fizzee!
Sing Wung no burnee!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t been so good to you as you
think I have, Sing Wung,” said honest
Kirke. “But I did put out the fuse. I’m
no end thankful for that!”</p>

<p>Still the Chinaman lingered, struggling in
vain for words to tell his feelings.</p>

<p>“Heap glad doggee no killee,” said he, at
last, pointing his hook-nailed forefinger at
Shot, who was at a safe distance from him.
“Heap glad Melican boy no lose doggee!”</p>

<p>And detesting as he did the whole canine
species, how could the simple Celestial have
said anything to give stronger proof of his
gratitude to Kirke?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>OFF FOR NEW YORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Seems’s</span> if Europe time wouldn’t ever, ever
come,” complained Weezy again and again.
For it was settled now that they were to go
in June at the beginning of the summer vacation.</p>

<p>The golf cape for the bisque Araminta
had long been finished, and Weezy having
nothing in particular to do spent hours in
watching the hands of the clock.</p>

<p>“They go creep, creep, creepmouse, just
as slow as ever they can,” she said to Kirke
one morning. “Can’t you put some of that
oil on them? I ’spect that would make them
turn ’round quicker.”</p>

<p>Kirke was in the yard cleaning his wheel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and Weezy on the doorstep dividing her attention
between him and the hall clock behind
her.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at the hands for five minutes,
Weezy. See if that doesn’t make them
travel faster,” returned Kirke, setting down
his little oil-can with a knowing smile. “How
would you like it yourself to have anybody
staring at you every second?”</p>

<p>Weezy laughed. It was pleasant to have
Kirke at home again. For weeks he had
spent half his time out of school hours at
the ranch, for of course he must see that
well finished. After quite a long illness, Yeck
Wo had recovered and come to the aid of
Sing Wung, who could drill hard pan well
enough, but would not light another fuse.</p>

<p>“It will never do to trust Sing Wung with
gunpowder again,” Mr. Keith had said in
confidence to the boys; “he is too excitable,
he loses his head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>From first to last the sinking of the well
had caused Mr. Keith great anxiety, and it
was a matter of rejoicing to him that the
explosions were now safely over and the
hard pan penetrated to a copious supply of
water beneath.</p>

<p>“Shot stares at me and stares at me, and
barks for nothing; but I don’t mind,” said
Weezy, stroking the little terrier as he frisked
up to her to be petted.</p>

<p>Kirke smiled approvingly. Shot was, indeed,
a privileged character in these days and
received few rebukes. He might even have
been allowed to accompany his master to the
Old World had not Captain Bradstreet looked
upon the proposal with disfavor. Dogs were
a nuisance in travelling, he said. They were
a trouble and an expense, and always liable
to get lost or stolen.</p>

<p>This settled it, and after mature reflection
Kirke arranged to leave his dog and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
burro with Manuel Carillo, a humble Spanish
boy whom he liked very much. Manuel was
fond of animals and would be kind to these,
Kirke felt sure.</p>

<p>Kirke and Molly made numerous calls in
the next few weeks, remarking to their
friends,—</p>

<p>“We came to bid you good-by before we sail
for Europe.”</p>

<p>And everybody said, “Oh, how I wish I
were going too!”</p>

<p>Vacation came at last, and with it the long-looked-for
day of departure. The party was
to go by rail to New York, and after resting
in that city a week take the steamer for
Havre, France.</p>

<p>In New York the Rowes were to visit
Mrs. Tracey, Mrs. Rowe’s sister, and she
had promised to provide a nurse-girl to go
to Europe with them and assume the care
of little Donald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>It was nine o’clock in the morning when
the travellers arrived at the railway station at
Silver Gate City. Captain Bradstreet and Mr.
Rowe checked the baggage, while Mrs. Rowe
entered the car followed by The Happy Six.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen a worse-looking half-dozen before
now, Mr. Rowe,” whispered the captain,
looking after the children with a proud smile.</p>

<p>“But never a merrier one, I’ll warrant,
Captain,” returned Mr. Rowe, his eyes fixed
on bright-eyed Weezy, who led the procession.</p>

<p>At her heels strutted little Donald in his
first sailor-suit. Then came flaxen-haired Paul
and his brunette sister, and behind them
fair, freckled Molly and brown, wide-a-wake
Kirke.</p>

<p>After they were all seated and the car had
begun to move, Molly gave a deep sigh of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We’ve started on our travels, Polly, do
you know it?” she said with a playful pinch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
of her friend’s arm. “Doesn’t it seem too
good to be true?”</p>

<p>That first day’s ride was bliss to The Happy
Six. They entertained themselves by gazing
from the car window, telling stories and getting
acquainted with some young girls bound
for Chicago.</p>

<p>But when at the approach of night the
colored porter came to make up the sleeping-berths,
Donald cried for his own little
“cribby,” and objected to going to bed in “a
cupboard with a curtain to it.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t a cupboard, it’s a berth, you dear
little <i>niggeramus</i>,” explained Weezy; and when
the others laughed at the miscalled word, she
thought they were laughing at Donald.</p>

<p>The little maid was drowsy herself by this
time, and quite willing to be helped to her
own berth above that of her little brother,
where she undressed behind the swaying draperies,
grumbling in an undertone because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
train wouldn’t stop jolting while she put on
her pink “slumber-wrapper.” She awoke next
morning grumbling at the heat of the car.</p>

<p>Kirke was dressed and stood waiting to
take her down in his arms.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s warm, but what are you going to
do about it, Miss? We’re crossing the desert,
you see, and didn’t think to take along any
good cool air for you to breathe.”</p>

<p>“Kirke, Kirke, no teasing,” said the mother
from her seat in front of them where she sat with
her bonnet on, entertaining Donald. “Weezy
means to be a good girl to-day, I hope, and not
to fret at what can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>“But I’m so sticky, mamma, and so dusty,”
murmured the little girl when she stood upon
the floor.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, so was I before I bathed.
Look at Kirke.”</p>

<p>After one glance, Weezy forgot her grievances
and laughed outright, for dark rings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
dirt had settled under her brother’s eyes and
a speck of soot upon the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>“The rest of us are ready for breakfast,
Kirke, and you must hurry to make yourself
presentable. The conductor says we eat at
the next station.”</p>

<p>Concealing his grimy face behind his pocket-handkerchief,
Kirke rushed past the seated
passengers to the men’s toilet-room, while
Weezy hastened to that of the women, where
Molly assisted her in dressing. To comb
Weezy’s fine, fluffy hair was never an easy
task, as she seldom stood still half a minute
at a time. To-day it was peculiarly trying,
because the motion of the train jolted her
about even when she would have been
quiet.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, Molly, you are most pulling my head
off!” she wailed, at a sudden lurch of the car
that tangled her ringlets into the comb.</p>

<p>Whereupon, Molly nervously set about repairing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
the mischief, declaring she was sorry,
and hadn’t meant to hurt Weezy.</p>

<p>Which of the sisters suffered the more before
the toilet was made, it were difficult to
tell; but I rather think it was Molly; and I
suspect that Molly told Pauline she did “hope
the nurse-girl from New York would take it
upon herself to attend to that child’s hair.”</p>

<p>However, by dint of haste, Weezy was
dressed at last, and on the arrival of the
train at the breakfast-station the whole party
went out to the dining-room and made a
hurried meal.</p>

<p>“They are to put on a dining-car at noon,
I’m happy to say, and we shall have our
dinner on the train,” remarked Mr. Rowe.
“I dislike this rapid eating.”</p>

<p>It was a nice dinner, well served, and The
Happy Six enjoyed it immensely. They
supped that night from their luncheon-basket
and called it a picnic. They had adjoining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
tables by themselves, and the three parents
were at a table farther down the aisle. They
were now beyond the desert, at Laguna, where
the train had been delayed for some hours by
an accident to the engine.</p>

<p>From the window at which Paul was seated
they caught a glimpse of the Indian city with
its clustering adobe houses and brown church
surmounted by a cross.</p>

<p>“Not much of a city,” commented Paul,
opening a box of sardines. “It looks more
like a village, a tiny, half-grown one into the
bargain.”</p>

<p>“But for all that, papa says it holds thousands
of Indians, just thousands!” said Kirke.
“They must be packed snug, like those little
fishes.”</p>

<p>“They’d pack better if they were longer
lengthwise and shorter widthwise,” laughed
Paul, glancing at a group of thick-set Indians
parading along the track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Why are those red men like heavy biscuits?”
asked Pauline, helping Donald to
orange marmalade.</p>

<p>“Because they’re ill-bred,” responded her
brother. Pauline shook her head.</p>

<p>“I know why they’re like heavy biscuits,”
exclaimed Weezy confidently. “Because you
can’t eat ’em.”</p>

<p>“Very bright, little Miss Weezy, but not
the answer,” returned Pauline amid general
merriment. “Kirke, you haven’t guessed.
Tell me this minute why those Indians are
like heavy biscuits?”</p>

<p>“Because”—Kirke thoughtfully squeezed
lemon juice upon his sardine—“because
every one of them is good for a shot.”</p>

<p>“No, no; you’re far from the mark! Molly,
now it’s your turn.”</p>

<p>“Is it because they’re both such a miserable
lot?” asked Molly dubiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you stupid guessers!” Pauline canted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
her head saucily. “Why, listen now, my
children. Those Indians and heavy biscuits
are alike because neither have been properly
raised.”</p>

<p>“They’re ill-bred, then, aren’t they, just as
I said,” retorted Paul, twisting his neck to
look at three Indian girls coming toward
the car. All wore blankets, not folded, but
hanging from their necks by the hems; and
their flowing, black hair was straight and
coarse, like a horse’s mane.</p>

<p>“Out with your camera, Paul!” said
Kirke, while Molly whispered,—</p>

<p>“Do look at their faces, a bright vermilion!”</p>

<p>“From their foreheads down to their chins.
What a waste of good paint!” Kirke whispered
back.</p>

<p>“Let’s take them something to eat,” said
Pauline, gathering up the fragments of the
luncheon.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, so we will,” cried Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>And the gay little party hurried forth to
feed the young squaws, and buy some of the
curious specimens of rocks they had brought
to sell.</p>

<p>Paul seized the opportunity to take a
“snap-shot” at the dusky damsels. Kirke
purchased of them several bits of colored
stone for his cabinet, and remarked later to
Paul that if those squaws couldn’t speak
English, they could tell a nickel from a dime
with their eyes shut.</p>

<p>This meeting with the Indians was a pleasant
experience to The Happy Six,—a much
pleasanter one than that which Kirke was
doomed to pass through on the morning
they entered New York.</p>

<p>Kirke’s experience occurred in this wise:
The night before they reached New York he
and Paul occupied a section at the front of
the sleeping-car next the door, Paul having
the lower and Kirke the upper berth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>After undressing, Kirke had rolled all his
clothes together into a bundle, which he
placed at the foot of his berth, where he
might lay his hands on it in the morning; for
he meant to be up early to see whatever
was to be seen.</p>

<p>But when he opened his eyes at sunrise,
the bundle had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>“Paul has hidden it for a joke,” was his
first thought; and he leaned over the edge
of his berth, and in an explosive whisper
charged his comrade with the theft.</p>

<p>“Taken your clothes? No; what did I
want of your clothes?” answered sleepy
Paul, a little cross at being roused from a
pleasant dream. “Why don’t you ring for
the porter?”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the honesty of
Paul’s tone. Kirke began to be nervous.
He pressed the electric bell by his window,
and the colored porter presently appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Want anything, sah?” he asked, thrusting
his woolly head between Kirke’s curtains.</p>

<p>“Yes, porter, I want my clothes! They
were in a bunch at the foot of my bed.
Haven’t you seen them?”</p>

<p>“No, sah; but I’ll try to find them, sah.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Rowe, Captain Bradstreet,
and Paul had dressed in haste, and were
now ready to join in the search.</p>

<p>But though they hunted all through the
car, their quest was in vain. The missing
garments were not to be found.</p>

<p>“The conductor thinks the thief must have
sneaked in and stolen them at the station
where we stopped at midnight,” said Paul,
coming back to Kirke with the unwelcome
news. “It seems the porter left the door
unlocked a minute while he ran out to send
a telegram for somebody.”</p>

<p>“And here I am in my night-gown, Paul!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
What on earth am I going to do?” groaned
Kirke behind his curtains.</p>

<p>These were the only curtains now visible
in the sleeper. The berths of all the other
sections had been put up for the day.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrageous shame, Kirke, an everlasting,
heathenish shame!” vociferated Paul;
but in the midst of his condolence he had to
burst out laughing at the sad predicament.</p>

<p>Kirke relieved his own feelings by throwing
a pillow at his friend. To himself the
situation was far from ludicrous, it was appalling.
The train was steaming on at the
rate of forty miles an hour; it would soon
land him in New York. Then what?</p>

<p>“Your father has gone to look up your
trunk and get out another suit for you,” continued
Paul, catching his breath.</p>

<p>“Good! But, oh dear, how can he open
the trunk without the key? The key was in
my pocket!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>But the key was not needed; the baggage
was not on that train.</p>

<p>A moment later, Mr. Rowe appeared at
the section, carrying on his arm a pair of
checked blue-and-white overalls.</p>

<p>“Well, Kirke, I’ve done my best for you,”
said he cheerily. “I’ve bought these of a
brakeman. By rolling up the hems, I think
you can manage to wear them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, those are a bonanza, Kirke.”</p>

<p>It was his mother’s voice at the boy’s elbow.
“And I’ve brought you other things
to put on. We’ll leave you now to dress.
Be as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>As the train ran into the New York station,
a rough-looking lad emerged from the
curtains clad in a brakeman’s overalls turned
up at the hem, Molly’s ulster, Mrs. Rowe’s
overshoes, and Captain Bradstreet’s smoking-cap.</p>

<p>“O Kirke, you look like”—Mrs. Rowe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
cut short Weezy’s comparison by a warning
glance.</p>

<p>“Like a California freak, Weezy. Why,
I knew that; did it on purpose,” retorted
Kirke, assuming an air of bravado.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Kirke, you look like a precious
mosaic,” said Pauline lightly, while the whole
party managed to crowd closely about the
nondescript boy.</p>

<p>Partially screened by his friends, the
“precious mosaic” of many colors skulked
along to a carriage and vaulted into it.
Here the little company separated for the
present, the Bradstreets proceeding to a
hotel in the city, and the Rowes to the home
of Mrs. Tracey, where they were to remain
till the sailing of the steamer.</p>

<p>“Auntie’ll think you’re bringing her an
almshouse boy, mamma,” Kirke said ruefully,
as they alighted before the Tracey mansion.</p>

<p>To greet his aunt and cousins in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
plight, and to be laughed at the livelong day,
was an embarrassing ordeal to the lad; but
he bore it manfully, and if afterwards he
made wry faces and stamped his foot, he did
it in the privacy of his own room, and nobody
was the wiser. And in the evening,
with the arrival of his trunk, the prolonged
and disagreeable trial came to an end.</p>

<small>OFF FOR EUROPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Silver Gate City party left New York
the next Saturday on the French steamer
<i>La Bretagne</i>, bound for Havre. They took
with them Jane Leonard, a girl of eighteen,
who was to have the care of Donald.</p>

<p>They went on board an hour before sailing,
and Molly and Pauline immediately ran
below deck to put in order the stateroom
which they were to share with Weezy. It
was a cosy, outside room near the middle of
the boat, with two berths, and opposite these
a cardinal velvet sofa on which Weezy was
to sleep.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky your brush-and-comb case has
a loop to hang it up by, Molly,” said Pauline,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
as they unpacked their toilet articles.
“You’d better pin it to your curtain where
you can reach it from your berth without
raising your head.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Molly, a little impatiently.
She sometimes thought her friend
rather too fond of dictating.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out what for when we get
into rough water and things go pitching
about the vessel,” responded Pauline in a
significant tone. “And please, please don’t
put that cologne bottle in the rack. If you
do ’twill rattle and dance and thump till it
breaks—or you wish it would.”</p>

<p>Molly meekly dropped the perfumery back
into her hand-bag, and hung the bag upon
a large hook beside the plate-glass mirror.</p>

<p>“You scare me to death, Polly,” she said,
with a shiver. “I almost wish I weren’t
going to sea.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, you’ll like the ocean when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
you get used to its tricks,” returned Pauline,
with the assurance of an old sailor. “How
big your eyes have grown, Miss Scared-to-death!
And they are just the color of purple
heliotrope.”</p>

<p>“The washed-out kind you mean, I suppose,
Polly?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, I mean the washed-in kind
that doesn’t fade,” said Pauline, giving Molly’s
auburn hair a vicious little pull. “You know
your eyes are perfectly lovely.”</p>

<p>“Come, girls.” Mrs. Rowe appeared in
their doorway from her stateroom across the
passage. “Let us go on deck; the air above
will be fresher.”</p>

<p>“So it will, mamma. Besides, we want to see
the land every minute we can,” sighed Molly.</p>

<p>As they mounted the stairs of the companion-way
side by side, she grasped her
mother’s hand and held it fast. Now that
the longed-for hour of sailing had actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
arrived, she felt an unexpected reluctance to
leaving the solid earth behind her and trusting
herself upon the heaving waters. But
she said nothing more about this to Pauline.
Pauline would not have understood her dread.
Neither for that matter would fearless Kirke
have understood it.</p>

<p>“I don’t see your father and the others,
Molly,” said Mrs. Rowe rather anxiously when
she and the girls stood on the crowded deck.
“I hope they won’t lose sight of Donald.”</p>

<p>Pauline sprang upon a neighboring settee,
where she could look down on the heads of
the people.</p>

<p>“Jane Leonard has him over there by the
rail,” she cried presently. “Mr. Rowe and
papa are close by them.”</p>

<p>“Then if the child is safe, we may as well
stay where we are,” returned Mrs. Rowe, disposing
herself upon the settee on which Molly
and Pauline were now leaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>Her words were lost in the general bustle
and confusion. Soon came the cry, “All
aboard!”</p>

<p>Visitors upon the boat rushed ashore, passengers
upon the shore rushed aboard. The
last to cross the gang-plank being the captain
of the vessel.</p>

<p>Then shouts of good-by arose from the
wharf, and answering shouts from the steamer;
the ropes were thrown off; and with hats and
handkerchiefs waving from her deck, <i>La
Bretagne</i> slipped from her moorings and glided
out into the harbor.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she a beauty, Molly?” cried Pauline,
tapping the back of the settee in her enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Who is a beauty?”</p>

<p>Molly glanced over her shoulder and saw
a graceful young lady seated upon a camp-stool
and sorrowfully gazing at the shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you speaking of that young lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
in mourning, Polly? She’s pretty, but don’t
you think she’s too pale?”</p>

<p>“I was speaking of the steamboat, you
dear little innocent,” answered Pauline, laughing.
“I hadn’t noticed the other lady before.
How white she is, isn’t she? All the color she
has is in her eyelids.”</p>

<p>“Poor thing, she must have cried herself
about blind, Polly.”</p>

<p>At this point Captain Bradstreet came
with the deck-steward to arrange the steamer-chairs
of the party. Paul and Kirke followed
with the shawls and travelling-rugs. Then
those who wished to do so extended themselves
at their ease and chatted or dozed till the
dinner-bell sounded. The sea was as smooth
as glass, and the only motion of the vessel was
that caused by the throbbing engines.</p>

<p>“I’m not a bit seasick, boys,” boasted Molly,
as all went down to dinner; “I expected to be,
but I’m not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“I hope you’ll not be sick during the passage,”
replied Paul, but his face wore a peculiar
smile. It was not the first time he had heard
people boast in this way before they were fairly
out to sea.</p>

<p>On entering the dining-room, Molly saw
three tables stretching from one end of it to
the other, and on either side of these tables
were rows of cardinal velvet chairs. Instead
of being supported by four legs, each chair
swung upon a pivot in a central standard
screwed to the floor.</p>

<p>“Our seats are at the middle table,” said
Paul. “There are your father and mother
just sitting down.”</p>

<p>Weezy was with them and whispered to
Molly as she paused beside her,—</p>

<p>“I tell you how to get into your chair, Molly.
You squeeze in sideways and then jiggle it
’round.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Weezy, I know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>Molly wished her little sister would not
make them both so conspicuous when the
young lady in mourning sat next Pauline on
the opposite side of the table and could hear
every word.</p>

<p>Molly’s place was between Kirke and Weezy
and over against Captain Bradstreet.</p>

<p>“You’re Number Fifteen, Molly,” said Kirke,
reading the black letters on his ivory napkin-ring.
“You’re Number Fifteen and I’m Number
Fourteen.”</p>

<p>“And I’m Number Sixteen,” added Weezy,
after squinting hard at her own ring.</p>

<p>“Yes, they treat us as if we were convicts in
a state’s prison,” Molly turned to Kirke with
a shrug. “You know they make convicts drop
their own names and answer to numbers.”</p>

<p>“I should have made a good convict, if I
had worn those overalls and”—</p>

<p>But here Kirke was interrupted by a waiter
bringing him a plate of soup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>They were a long time at dinner, which consisted
of several courses and ended with harlequin
ice-cream,—red, green, and white.</p>

<p>Donald’s nurse had given her charge an
early supper in the children’s cabin, and when
the party returned to the deck he was already
in bed.</p>

<p>“My little brother can’t stay awake after
dark ’cause it makes him cross,” Weezy frankly
explained to the pale young lady in black with
whom she had become friendly during dinner.</p>

<p>“Can’t he? That’s unfortunate,” replied
the young lady, smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care. Not so very cross.”</p>

<p>Weezy was eying keenly a bag of black
alligator skin dangling from her companion’s
belt. It was rather larger than an ordinary
reticule, and furnished with a steel clasp and
chain. The young lady played absently with
the chain while talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i091">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i091.jpg" alt="Oh! I’m ever so sorry">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">‘Oh! I’m ever so sorry,’ said Weezy</span>”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Page <a href="#Page_87">87</a></i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“She pets her pretty bag like a kitten. I
wonder what’s in it?” thought Weezy, wishing
it would not be rude to inquire. She
suspected that it contained something very,
very precious.</p>

<p>“Didn’t anybody come with you, lady?”
she questioned shyly, being exceedingly desirous
to know. “Are you all <i>sole</i> alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; all sole alone.” The speaker’s
voice trembled. “My father had intended
to cross the ocean with me; but he
was taken suddenly ill last month, and—he
has died.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m ever so sorry,” replied Weezy,
with tears in her eyes, thinking how she
should feel if it were her own papa.
“Haven’t you any mamma?”</p>

<p>The young lady shook her head, not trusting
herself to speak.</p>

<p>Weezy’s hand stole quietly into that of her
new friend.</p>

<p>“That’s dreadful—not to have any papa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and mamma! Don’t you want to see <i>my</i>
mamma? Please come over to the other
side of the boat, and I’ll <i>induce</i> you to her.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling; but I’d rather not
go.”</p>

<p>“My mamma’s very nice,” pleaded Weezy.
“Her name is Mrs. Rowe. My name is
Louise Rowe, only ’most all the time it’s
Weezy.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure your mother must be very nice,
Miss Louise. She has a lovely expression;
yet, all the same, I can’t intrude upon her.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could,” said Weezy, wondering
what was meant by “intrude.” “If you
could, you wouldn’t be lonesome, ’cause we
have ten peoples—only Donald is abed.”</p>

<p>“With ten in your party, Miss Louise, I’m
sure you have enough <i>peoples</i> without me,”
responded the young lady in crape, unconsciously
cheered by the child’s artless sympathy.
“Look, your mamma is beckoning you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Mrs. Rowe had feared lest her sociable little
daughter might annoy the stranger; but
after hearing Weezy’s story about her, changed
her mind.</p>

<p>“The poor girl looks very sad and lonely,”
she said, watching the sweet, sensitive face,
which she had observed at dinner. “I’ll go
back with you, Weezy, and speak to her.”</p>

<p>And having crossed the deck, she gracefully
introduced herself to the desolate young
lady in mourning, who in return gave her
own name as Miss Evans.</p>

<p>“Cannot I prevail upon you, Miss Evans,
to make my little daughter and the rest of us
happy, by joining us?” said Mrs. Rowe cordially.
“We have a vacant seat to offer you.”</p>

<p>There was no resisting the rare charm of
the lady’s manner, and the desolate stranger
gladly accepted the invitation, though on
being presented to the other members of the
party she betrayed great shyness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Evidently unaccustomed to society,”
thought Mrs. Rowe; “yet so cultivated and
refined! I can’t quite understand it.”</p>

<p>After they had become better acquainted,
Miss Evans told her that her father and
herself had always lived together a retired
life, seeing more of books than of people.
He was a scientist, and had devoted many
years to preparing a learned work on
biology.</p>

<p>“As soon as his book was finished, papa
meant to take a vacation with me, Mrs.
Rowe,” she said tremulously. “We were to
visit my uncle in Paris. But the very day
after our passage on the steamer had been
engaged, papa had a fatal stroke of paralysis.
And so,” added Miss Evans, with touching
pathos, “and so I came alone.”</p>

<p>“Alone in one sense, my dear Miss Evans;
yes, sadly alone,” replied Mrs. Rowe with
feeling. “But please consider yourself one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
of our large party. Please look upon us all
as your friends.”</p>

<p>She pressed the young mourner’s hand
warmly as she spoke, and resolved to do all
in her power to enliven her voyage.</p>

<p>Molly and Pauline bestowed stealthy glances
upon the diffident newcomer shrouded in
black in Donald’s chair. In the splendor of
the moonlight her pale face assumed an unearthly
radiance, and Kirke remarked confidentially
to Paul that she was “a regular
stunner.”</p>

<p>“Solemn as a tombstone, though,” responded
Paul. “And see her hang on to
that bag at her belt! Anybody’d think it
was a life-preserver.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it was once, when the skin
was on the alligator’s back,” laughed Kirke.
“Hark, Paul, your father is beginning a
story!”</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet’s stories were always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
worth hearing, and the evening being warm
and still, the little company was beguiled into
remaining up until a late hour to listen to
some of his thrilling experiences at sea.</p>

<p>“What delightful people these are!” thought
the lonely Miss Evans. “It is such a solace
to be with them. And I had not expected to
speak with a soul on board.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>TEN AND ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day the weather continued fine.
The ship passed schools of porpoises sporting
in the sun and splashing the water like swimming
children at play.</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet told Weezy that these
porpoises were sometimes called fish-hogs.
They not only drive shoals of herrings and
salmon and mackerel before them, but they
sometimes dive to the bottom of the sea and
root for eels and sea-worms, as pigs on land
root for acorns buried under leaves.</p>

<p>The second morning Paul descried a sporting
whale to leeward, and an hour later an ocean
steamer. When the vessels were near each
other, <i>La Bretagne</i> ran up several small flags.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“Those flags ask, ‘Have you seen any
icebergs?’” said Captain Bradstreet.</p>

<p>And when the other vessel signalled by
flags that the passage was clear, he seemed
greatly pleased.</p>

<p>“I always dread to meet icebergs in a
fog,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“But there isn’t a speck of fog to-day,
Captain Bradstreet,” put in Weezy.</p>

<p>“No, not yet, but we shall run into it off
the Banks, little maiden.”</p>

<p>“What banks, Captain Bradstreet?” asked
Weezy, taking a peep through his spy-glass, which
rested across the top of Molly’s chair. “I don’t
see anything around here but just water.”</p>

<p>“I mean the banks of Newfoundland, an
island; but you needn’t look for them, you
can’t see them.”</p>

<p>“I can see something though,—something
white. Look, look, Captain Bradstreet! Don’t
you believe it’s going to begin to fog?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“Already? Is that so?” The captain
raised the glass and peered through it himself.
“Yes, you’re right, Bright-Eyes. The
fog <i>is</i> ‘going to begin’ to bear down upon us.”</p>

<p>And in a few moments the white fog had
shrouded the vessel from stem to stern. Then
came at frequent intervals the dreary sound
of the fog-horn.</p>

<p>“What a hoarse old thing!” exclaimed
Weezy, stopping her ears in disgust. “It brays
just like Kirke’s burro, only awful worse.”</p>

<p>“As if it had a long sore throat,” laughed
Molly, buttoning her sister’s cape at the neck.</p>

<p>“They’re manning all the lookouts,” remarked
the wise Pauline.</p>

<p>“They’re doing what, Pauline? And what
are they doing it <i>to</i>?” asked Molly playfully.
“Won’t you please speak English?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear, stupid old land-sparrow!
Don’t you see those wooden cages high
above the forecastle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“I don’t know what the forecastle is; but
do you mean those little platforms with fences
round them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, those are the lookouts. There are
five on this steamer,—I’ve counted,—and the
mate has sent a sailor to each one to watch
and sing out if there’s danger of our running
into anything.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! I wouldn’t be in their places for
a hundred dollars,” said Molly. “But Kirke
would like it, you may depend. I never heard
of such a boy! To think of the way he went
down into that well to save Sing Wung!”</p>

<p>“Kirke is a noble little fellow,” returned
Captain Bradstreet heartily, to Molly’s intense
satisfaction. “And here he is now, coming
aft, and Paul is behind him.”</p>

<p>Pauline flirted her handkerchief at the lads
as her father spoke, and they walked across
the wet deck toward her, Paul slipping once
on the way and nearly falling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“A miss is as good as a mile,” said his sister
merrily, when he came up to her.</p>

<p>“Some misses are as good as two miles, if
not better,” said Kirke, attempting to be witty
and bowing with much gallantry first to Pauline
and next to Molly. “Oh, girls, I tell you
we’ve been having fun!”</p>

<p>“With what, Kirke?” they both inquired.
“With shuffle-board?”</p>

<p>“No, no, not with shuffle-board, but with—well,
you might call it ‘shovel-aboard,’ if
you want to,” said Kirke, “dropping into”
wit again; whereupon Paul chuckled and
cried, “Pretty good, Kirke. You see we’ve
been watching the men shovel coal into the
furnace.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we go down there, too?” asked
Molly, taking a step forward.</p>

<p>“No, indeed, not you girls! You’d spoil
your dresses. Why, the furnaces are a deck
below the boilers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“And halfway down the stairs give out
and you have to go the rest of the way on
a ladder,” added Kirke.</p>

<p>“It’s a droll place, though, when you get
there,” resumed Paul. “Coal-bins all around,—they
call ’em bunkers,—and stokers black
as soot wheeling the coal to the furnaces in
barrows.”</p>

<p>“Stokers?” repeated Weezy. “Kirke, did
I ever see a stoker? Is it a donkey?”</p>

<p>“Not always, little Miss Quiz,” replied
Kirke with a giggle; and they all laughed,
as if she had said something very foolish.</p>

<p>“Now, I know you’re making fun. I
think you’re as unpolite as you can be!”</p>

<p>Her head drooped; but before the tears
could fall, Captain Bradstreet soothed her
wounded feelings by whispering in her ear
that little girls who had never been to sea
couldn’t be expected to know about stokers.
He would tell her in confidence that stokers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
are the men who tend the fires on a steamboat.</p>

<p>“The poor souls weren’t more than half
dressed,” said Paul, when peace had been
restored. “But still they looked ready to
melt. You never saw such a fire as they
keep up in those furnaces, girls.”</p>

<p>“Threw coal into the fire-boxes every minute
or two,” interposed Kirke.</p>

<p>Molly suddenly fell to dusting her brother’s
coat with her handkerchief. “You’ve run
against something white, Kirke. And so has
Paul. They don’t keep their flour-barrels
down there, I should hope.”</p>

<p>“No; that’s a stoker’s mark. One of the
stokers drew a chalk-line around our waists
and said we couldn’t go till we’d paid our
fee.”</p>

<p>“A stupid joke, I should call it,” said Molly,
for the chalk-mark was hard to remove.</p>

<p>“A pretty old joke,” responded the captain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
“They always try it on visitors. I
hope you took it in good part, boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, papa,” said Paul. “Each of us
gave the man a dime.”</p>

<p>“And made money by it, too,” declared
Kirke. “’Twas well worth a quarter to be
let out of that hot hole.”</p>

<p>“I’d like some of the heat up here,” said
Molly, her teeth chattering. “Miss Evans
had to put away her writing and go below,
her hands were so stiff.”</p>

<p>“She’s writing a story, Kirke, and she’ll
read it to me sometime. She promised she
would,” exclaimed Weezy, very proud of the
notice she received from her new friend.</p>

<p>“We just met her at the foot of the companion-way
with her tablet in her hand,”
said Kirke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Paul, “and she was clutching
that bag of hers, as usual. I believe
she’s carrying diamonds in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Then you must believe her to be a very
silly young woman, my son. I wonder you
don’t tell her that passengers are expected
to give their valuables to the purser, to be
locked in his safe,” observed the captain
jestingly. “For my part, I never should
suspect that the poor girl was rolling in
gold.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure she isn’t rich. She dresses very
plainly,” said Pauline. “By the way, what
makes rich people want to ‘roll,’ I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Especially in gold,” added Molly flippantly,
as they entered the dining-saloon. “I
shouldn’t want to roll in gold, of all things.
It’s one of the hardest things in the world.”</p>

<p>“And the hardest to get,” broke in Paul,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“What would you like to roll in, Molly?
Soft money?” said Kirke, with a grin of his
own. “That shows your politics, miss.
You’re a soft-money girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“A soft, mooney girl, Kirke Rowe? She’s
no such thing. I deny it!” cried Pauline,
pretending to have misunderstood. “Now
bring the Alphabet Bewitched, there’s a good
boy, and we’ll have a game of letters.”</p>

<p>With the beginning of the game, the children’s
lively banter ceased, and Captain Bradstreet
walked off to the further end of the
saloon to converse with Mr. and Mrs. Rowe.</p>

<p>That was the last quiet morning on board
ship for three long days; for in the night a
rough gale swept over the sea, tossing the
vessel to and fro, and almost hurling passengers
from their berths. Once Molly was
awakened by a loud crash, and cried out in
terror to Pauline in the upper berth.</p>

<p>“It’s only dishes breaking in the dining-saloon,”
yawned Pauline, turning over. “Why
don’t you go to sleep?”</p>

<p>As her father proudly said, Pauline was a
chip of the old block, a born sailor. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
liked the swell of the ocean. She was never
timid, never seasick. The same was true of
Captain Bradstreet and of Kirke. They all
went to the dining-table three times a day,
sometimes five, undisturbed even though the
plates might dance a jig, and the glasses in
the rack above them jingle and jump and
threaten to come down upon their heads.</p>

<p>The rest of the party, more or less ill for
a time, rallied after the abatement of the
storm—all of them but Weezy. When at
last able to be carried on deck, she was
still pale and languid, and felt rather forlorn.</p>

<p>The rest of the company made every effort
to entertain her, but in vain. There were only
two people on whom the little maid would
condescend to smile. One of these was Miss
Evans, who read aloud some of the delightful
tales she had written; the other was a young
man who never even spoke to the child; but
you will hear of him in the following chapter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>ELEVEN IN FRANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the passengers on the ship,—and
there were perhaps six hundred,—none interested
the boys of The Happy Six like the
young man with one leg, who was going to
London and Paris to astonish the people by
his tricks on a bicycle.</p>

<p>He had a wife, a very pleasant young
woman, and Molly and Pauline liked to talk
with her. She told them she was in the
habit of riding on her own wheel, ahead of
her husband, and throwing balls in the air
for him to fire at as he followed her; and he
never failed to hit the balls.</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” cried Pauline.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the wife proudly; “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
really not so wonderful as his spinning his
wheel down a toboggan slide. That is something
that has never yet been done by any
man with two legs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should hope not,” said Molly; “it
makes me shudder to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Look, look,” cried Pauline; “see what he
is doing now!”</p>

<p>Some one was playing the fiddle, and this
extraordinary young man was actually dancing
in perfect time with one foot. He was
laughing, too, and seemed to enjoy the performance
as much as any one else.</p>

<p>He was always in good spirits, so his wife
said; and he assured the boys that he did
not mind the loss of his leg.</p>

<p>“There’s a philosopher for you,” said Mr.
Rowe to Captain Bradstreet; and when the
dancing was over, they both went up and
shook hands cordially with the happy trick-cyclist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>And now the ship was almost at the end of
her voyage. On the afternoon of the Fourth
of July the deck was crowded with passengers
looking pleased and expectant.</p>

<p>Presently across the sea to port was discerned
a brown speck, and caps went up with
a shout.</p>

<p>“What are you all making such a noise
for? Tell me quick!” cried Weezy, running
to the rail where Paul stood clapping his
hands. By this time Weezy had quite recovered
and was again her healthy, inquisitive
little self.</p>

<p>“We’ve sighted Land’s End, Weezy Rowe,
that’s what,” answered Paul, with unwonted
excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Are we coming to the end of
the world, Paul?” Weezy’s eyes sparkled like
twin stars. “Are we truly, truly?”</p>

<p>“No, no, not to the end of the world, Miss
Quizzy.” Paul smothered a laugh. “We’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
only coming to the end of England. There’s
a long stretch of world beyond that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad!” sighed Weezy.</p>

<p>And as they sailed closer to the shore, she
added in a tone of disapproval,—</p>

<p>“Land’s End is a weeny bit of a thing,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Not very large, Weezy. That sharp tongue
is called Lizard’s Point. People there are watching
out and every time an ocean steamer comes
in, they telegraph about it to New York.”</p>

<p>“Why, Paul, I think that’s telling tales.
Can’t a ship”—began Weezy; but was interrupted
by this glad cry from Kirke,—</p>

<p>“The pilot boat! Paul, the <i>pi-lot</i> boat!”</p>

<p>A white-winged yacht was approaching.
When it had come near enough, the steamer
stopped and took the pilot on board. The
passengers smiled as he mounted the rope-ladder
at the vessel’s side, for now they knew
they should land in France the next morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
No vessel is ever allowed to land without
a pilot to show her the way.</p>

<p>“Come, Weezy, it’s time to dress for dinner,”
said Molly a little later, pausing in a
promenade with Miss Evans. “We want to
look our very best to-night, Weezy, because
the captain is going to give a grand Fourth
of July banquet.”</p>

<p>“I knew that; I heard it before you did,
Molly Rowe.”</p>

<p>Weezy skipped away with her sister to
their stateroom, and when the bell rang they
entered the dining-saloon, arrayed in their
finest apparel.</p>

<p>The saloon was a brilliant mass of color.
American flags draped the walls; the tables
were decked in red, white, and blue; and
every napkin was a white tower with a small
flag at its top.</p>

<p>“They’ve planted our ‘Old Glory’ everywhere,”
said Paul. “Only see!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>It was really a grand banquet and lasted
a long while. With the dessert were passed
little favors of colored tissue paper. Kirke’s
favor proved to be a blue Liberty cap which
he put on with much glee. Paul and Weezy
had Marie Stewart bonnets; Pauline and Molly
red military hats.</p>

<p>After-dinner speeches followed, the French
people complimenting the Americans, and the
Americans complimenting the French. And
then, having returned thanks to the captain
for his courtesy, the guests arose from the
feast.</p>

<p>In leaving the room Molly turned to speak
with Miss Evans and observed that she had
exchanged her black serge travelling dress for
one of mourning silk, but still wore at her
belt the large, conspicuous reticule.</p>

<p>“A leather bag at a grand dinner! What
strange taste!” she thought. “And yet Miss
Evans is certainly a lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>In the morning they landed at the port of
Havre and passed through the Custom House.
There, to Weezy’s great indignation, their
trunks were opened and searched. When a
dark, sour-looking officer handled roughly her
cherished Araminta, the little girl could no
longer contain herself, but in her anxiety exclaimed
aloud,—</p>

<p>“Please, sir, lift my doll easy! Sometimes
her eye falls out!”</p>

<p>He never answered, never even looked up,
but went on holding the unfortunate Araminta
upside down in his left hand, while with his
right hand he fumbled about among the contents
of the box.</p>

<p>Weezy considered his conduct extremely
rude, and was very angry with him, till her
mother suggested that as he was a Frenchman
he might not have understood what she
said.</p>

<p>After the luggage had been examined and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
chalked with a capital letter D, our party
drove to the Frascati, a large hotel, for breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast the boys walked off to the
immense stone bath-house across the court.
A white-capped old woman sat at a desk in
the broad entrance hall, writing accounts in a
ledger. The boys had French money—francs
and centimes—which they had received from
the purser on the ship in exchange for United
States money.</p>

<p>Paul could speak a little French, and he
bought the bath-tickets, paying an extra sum
for soap and towels.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope that’s mean enough!” said
Kirke, when this was explained to him. “Do
they charge extra for the water, too?”</p>

<p>Then they followed a waiting-maid up-stairs
into separate bath-rooms; and again Kirke was
astonished, for when he had entered his room,
the girl turned the key and locked him in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
To the American boy, unused to foreign customs,
this seemed a strange proceeding.</p>

<p>When he had made his toilet, rung a bell,
and been released from solitary confinement,
he ran out to seek Paul in the waiting-room.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Paul Bradstreet! That
girl locked me into my room!”</p>

<p>“Well, she locked me into mine, too; that’s
a way they have in this country.”</p>

<p>Kirke related his experience to the girls that
afternoon in a very graphic way, as the quartette
strolled together on the heights.</p>

<p>Pauline laughed, and Molly demurely remarked
that she had never heard before of
a country where people were shut up who
hadn’t been naughty!</p>

<p>“Be careful, Molly, or President Faure may
hear you,” said Paul, in pretended alarm. “I
suppose he is in that square, cream-colored
house this minute; it’s where he lives in the
summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“How do you know that?” asked Pauline.
“Who said so?”</p>

<p>“The head clerk at the hotel described it
to me.”</p>

<p>“<i>Head clerk</i>, indeed! You mean <i>concierge</i>,”
corrected his sister. “One would think you
had never been abroad before. You must
use the French names.”</p>

<p>“A queer country,” said Molly. “No matter
how gray-headed a man is, they call him
<i>garçon</i>; and <i>garçon</i> means boy.”</p>

<p>It had been Miss Evans’s original plan to
proceed directly from Havre to Paris; but
on being urged by her Silver Gate friends to
visit with them various points of interest
along the road, she could not resist the invitation.</p>

<p>“I came to France mainly on account of
an important errand in Paris,” she said to
Mrs. Rowe. “I’ve been wanting to tell you
about it, only I can’t mention the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
without crying. But now I find that the
people I wish to see will be out of the city
for another week or two. And so,” she continued,
drying her eyes, “I believe I may
allow myself this pleasant holiday with you.”</p>

<p>Accordingly she wired her uncle that he
need not expect her at present, as she was
to join the Silver Gate party next morning
for a carriage-drive through picturesque
Normandy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS BAG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Silver Gate tourists all assembled for
breakfast in the hotel dining-room dressed
for their excursion. The clothes worn by
them on shipboard had been packed in a
box to be forwarded to Liverpool, in readiness
for the home voyage, and The Happy
Six appeared now in tidy new suits. Miss
Evans wore a neat black mohair and a fresh
black straw hat, but had not laid aside the
familiar reticule.</p>

<p>“The bag looks like a padlock, Paul. Do
you suppose she needs all that to fasten her
belt?”</p>

<p>“It seems like it,” murmured Paul.</p>

<p>But the remarks were strictly confidential.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
The boys would not have injured Miss
Evans’s feelings on any account: they were
too well-bred for that. Besides, they liked
her very much.</p>

<p>The early breakfast—or <i>le café</i>—consisted
of <i>café au lait</i>,—which is coffee
served with boiled milk,—rolls, and unsalted
butter. This butter had been moulded into
the shape of wild roses, with petals as thin
as wafers, and each guest had two of these
wee roses on a tiny dish beside his plate
at table.</p>

<p>“Papa enjoys the butter, don’t you see,
mamma?” said Molly, in a low tone as they
left the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Yes, I observed it,” returned her mother,
looking pleased. “I fancy his appetite is
really improving.”</p>

<p>Then they all mounted the black jaunting-car
waiting in the court. Donald was in
boisterous spirits: so delighted at his escape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
from the confinement of the steamer that he
could hardly contain himself.</p>

<p>The two seats of the car ran lengthwise
and faced each other. Miss Evans sat near
the front, just behind the driver’s box, which
the voluble coachman shared with Captain
Bradstreet. French <i>cochers</i> are very fond
of imparting information, and this one discoursed
so rapidly concerning the farms,
houses, and people along the way that the
captain finally turned around to Miss Evans
with a comical look of despair, and said,—</p>

<p>“<i>Will</i> you please tell me what this man
is raving about? He telescopes his words
so that I can’t understand him.”</p>

<p>“He was speaking just now of these neat piles
of broken stone by the roadside, Captain Bradstreet,”
replied Miss Evans, smiling. “He says
government requires every man to furnish a
given weight—I missed the number of pounds—of
this crushed stone to repair the highways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“That’s why the roads look so very neat.
Just the thing for bicycles. I wish they had
such a law in the United States.”</p>

<p>“I made the same remark to the <i>cocher</i>,”
returned Miss Evans, who seemed to talk to
the man with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>After this, she was constantly appealed to
for translating French into English. On one
of these occasions, Mrs. Rowe said, with one
of her affable smiles, “We are grateful to
you, Miss Evans, for acting as our interpreter.
Mr. Rowe and I find ourselves sadly
rusty in French.”</p>

<p>“So are Molly and I, Miss Evans,” added
Pauline. “You never would dream that
we’ve just been studying it; now would
you?”</p>

<p>“And we had good marks at school, too,”
said Molly. “I don’t see what the trouble
is.”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Pauline. “<i>We</i> are not one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
bit to blame. The people don’t understand
their own language, that’s all. Ask ’em a
question, and they just shake their heads and
rattle off the sounds of the vowels,—‘A, ah,
aw, ă, ē, e,’ and so on.”</p>

<p>Pauline was a capital mimic, and rendered
this burlesque of foreign speech with a drollery
that provoked loud applause and aroused
Donald to a high pitch of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“A, ah, ow; bow, wow wow,” he screamed,
waving his little hands like Pauline.</p>

<p>Jane Leonard quietly slipped her arm about
his waist to prevent his falling from the carriage,
and whispered him to be quiet, for
her head ached. She considered little Number
Six a very noisy child. Though too
young to appreciate the quaint, beautiful pictures
of the constantly changing landscape,
he enjoyed their novelty, and was constantly
trying to express his delight.</p>

<p>“And this is Normandy,” said Mrs. Rowe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
drawing a long breath of satisfaction; “picturesque
Normandy.”</p>

<p>Ancient houses, on which were growing
grass and flowers,—among the flowers the
<i>fleur-de-lis</i>, or lily of France. By the roadside,
gorgeous red poppies, hobnobbing with
the blue corn-flower or bachelor’s button.
Acres and acres of sugar beets, and of flax,
and of absinthe. In one valley, some peasants—men
and women—were pulling the
absinthe and laying it in rows to dry.</p>

<p>“They should burn it instead,” Captain
Bradstreet remarked rather severely. “The
drink they make from absinthe intoxicates
and does them much harm.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a good medicine and brings them
a deal of money,” said Mr. Rowe.</p>

<p>Farther on, at a turning of the road, Donald
gave an ecstatic little scream and pointed with
his finger.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, mamma, look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>An old dame was approaching, leading five
cows abreast, all tied together by the horns.</p>

<p>“She seems to be moving her dairy,” remarked
Kirke to the carriage at large.</p>

<p>“<i>Her</i> dairy? The dairy of the whole
neighborhood, more likely,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“A <i>cow</i>-operative dairy,” suggested Pauline
quickly, whereupon they all laughed.</p>

<p>A little way behind the “co-operative dairy”
followed a young peasant woman in a short
dress trundling a black baby carriage.</p>

<p>“Think of a solemn black carriage like
that for a dear little baby!” exclaimed Mrs.
Rowe. “Yet the French are called a cheerful
people!”</p>

<p>They passed black Norman carts with enormous
wheels, and the carts were drawn by
Norman horses with large hairy feet.</p>

<p>“Not a bit like America anywhere,” said
Kirke, “and I’m glad of it. We came here
to see something new.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>It was late in the afternoon when The
Happy Six and their elders reached the fishing
village where they were to spend the
night. Its gray stone inn was more than
two hundred years old, and like many inns
in Europe had once been a castle. There
were no carpets, but the floors were spotlessly
white, and the copper saucepans and
kettles in the kitchen shone through the
windows of the room as the setting sun
shone through the ruins on the neighboring
cliff.</p>

<p>After dinner the gentlemen and lads of the
company prowled about these ruins in the
twilight, while Pauline and Molly chatted in
the inn parlor with three young English girls
boarding with their mother in the house.</p>

<p>Miss Evans, wearing the alligator-skin bag,
as was her habit, came in to read by the
lamp upon the centre-table; but, after Weezy
and Donald were in bed, went to assist Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Rowe in the care of Jane Leonard, who was
now suffering severely from headache.</p>

<p>The next day Jane could not raise her head
from the pillow. Mrs. Rowe and Miss Evans
sat with her by turns, while Donald was left
to the care of the rest of the party.</p>

<p>This disposal of himself suited his little
lordship, for, everybody’s business being nobody’s,
he was allowed to run at large, and
within certain limits do about as he pleased.</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet, Paul, and Kirke had
set out early for another peep at the ruins,
and as soon as the dew was off the grass
Donald slipped away from his father, lounging
in front of the hotel, and trudged behind
Weezy and the older girls toward the sea.</p>

<p>The beaten path which they followed ended
abruptly at the smooth, flat cobble-stones of
the shelving beach. Here stood a row of
disabled old fishing-boats, drawn up above the
dashing of the tide and fashioned into rude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
cottages, each with a thatched roof, narrow
door, and two or three small windows.</p>

<p>It was in these tiny buildings that the
fishermen stored their wares. As the children
drew near, fish-wives were sitting upon
the door-steps of some of the boat-houses,
netting seines of coarse green twine. A few
of the women wore starched white caps with
wide, flopping borders. The rest were bare-headed,
and the sun stared saucily down at
their shiny red faces.</p>

<p>“Let’s speak to the best-looking one, Pauline,”
suggested Molly, as they sauntered
along the row of women.</p>

<p>“To the least ugly one, you mean, don’t
you?” returned Pauline, casting a scrutinizing
glance at the busy workers.</p>

<p>“The least ugly one is that woman straight
ahead in the sky-blue apron.”</p>

<p>“She has hair on her chin, Polly.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t they all, or nearly all, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
fastidious creature? And isn’t she the only
one that looks reconciled to it?” Pauline
rattled on. “I think she deserves to be
noticed.” And stepping up to the peasant,
she made a graceful bow, and said,—</p>

<p>“<i>Bon jour, madame.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Bon jour, ma’m’selle</i>,” replied the fish-wife
politely, not pausing from her netting. Then
nodding toward Donald, she added something
about “<i>le joli petit enfant</i>.”</p>

<p>“She seems to be delivering an oration,
Molly,” murmured mischievous Pauline with
a serious countenance.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Polly, don’t make me laugh in her
face,” entreated Molly, her lips twitching.
“She said Donald was a pretty little child.
I understood as much as that.”</p>

<p>“Pretty? Of course he is, and he’s sweet;
but that’s no reason why she should run her
words all together like melted caramels,”
retorted Pauline, looking straight at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
woman and speaking in an easy, conversational
tone.</p>

<p>The woman sat there, serenely unconscious
that she was talked about, and Molly had
to turn away to hide her merriment. It was
one of her minor trials that Pauline could, at
almost any time, surprise her into a giggle,
while remaining herself as sedate as an owl.</p>

<p>As Molly was looking toward the hotel,
she happened to espy the three English girls
tripping down the path in Indian file, swinging
long towels in their hands.</p>

<p>“They are actually going in bathing,”
said Molly, pretending that this was what
she was laughing at.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> want to go bavin’,” echoed Donald,
hopping up and down on the great loose
cobble-stones. “<i>I</i> want to go bavin’.”</p>

<p>In his excitement he lost his unsteady footing,
and pitching headlong into the fish-net,
became entangled in it like a fly in a cobweb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Molly extricated him as deftly and quickly
as she could, though this was a work of
time, because he struggled and twisted himself
about and kept catching his active little
fingers in the meshes.</p>

<p>But the annoying little incident had not
diverted the boy in the least from his original
desire. He was no sooner free than he repeated
emphatically,—</p>

<p>“I say, I want to go bavin’.”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, precious,” answered Molly,
smoothing his hair, which the net had tossed
this way and that, till the child’s head resembled
a thistle gone to seed. “We can’t any
of us go into the ocean to-day, not even
Kirke. We didn’t bring our bathing-suits
with us, you see, Donny.”</p>

<p>Her reply provoked from her little brother
a heartrending shriek which drew the three
English lassies in haste to his side.</p>

<p>“Poor little fellow, we saw him fall into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
that net. Is he dreadfully hurt?” cried the
eldest, whom her sisters called Edith.</p>

<p>“It is a dreadful thing to fall into the
<i>Seine</i>,” replied Pauline, who never could resist
the chance to make a pun.</p>

<p>“No, he was not hurt,” said Molly. “Only
in his little feelings, because I can’t let him
go in bathing, Miss Edith. We haven’t his
bathing-suit here, and if we had, I don’t believe
mamma would dare let him go into the sea.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t she allow him to take off his
shoes and stockings and wade in the shallow
water?” asked kind Miss Edith, wishing to
see the grieving child happy.</p>

<p>“Mamma would, mamma would,” piped
Donald, taking it upon himself to answer the
question.</p>

<p>“Do you think so, little sailor?”</p>

<p>Miss Edith caressingly touched the embroidered
anchor upon the collar of his navy-blue
jacket, and turning to Molly said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Because I know of a nice, shallow pool
where little ones often wade. It is over there
between those two rocks near the foot of the
chalk cliffs.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Edith, you’re very kind
to tell us about it,” replied Molly, wiping
Donald’s eyes, again beginning to twinkle.
“You are sure it is perfectly safe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it’s so far from the sea that the
waves never wash into it except at high tide.”</p>

<p>This was all true; and thinking she had
done a kindness to the young Americans,
Miss Edith gave them a pleasant nod and
followed her sisters to the bath-house lower
down the beach, to prepare for a plunge into
the ocean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>WHERE IS NUMBER SIX?</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span>, go wadin’; Molly, please come,”
coaxed Donald, pulling at his sister’s skirt
before the English girls were out of hearing.</p>

<p>“Yes, in a minute, little brother.”</p>

<p>Molly lingered to tell the fish-wife in painstaking
French that they were sorry to have
interrupted her netting.</p>

<p>The woman puzzled over Molly’s words as
Molly and Pauline had previously puzzled
over her own, for the language of Paris is
far different from the <i>patois</i> of Normandy.</p>

<p>“She looks as black as the boat-house,”
observed roguish Pauline, at the same time
glancing tenderly at the old peasant, as if
paying her a compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“You sha’n’t guy the poor woman, Polly;
that’s shabby,” expostulated her comrade.
“But tell me how to make her understand
what I said.”</p>

<p>“Smile at her, Molly, and shake your head
at Donald, then at the seine. See how that
will work.”</p>

<p>Apparently it worked well. The fish-wife
smiled at Molly in return and spread out the
seine to show that it was uninjured.</p>

<p>“It’s a minute now!” cried Donald at the
end of his scanty allowance of patience. “Please
go, Molly, please, please!”</p>

<p>“We’re going this very second, Donny;
but what a little tease you are!” returned his
sister, taking his chubby hand in hers.</p>

<p>Then, bidding adieu to the matron of the
quaint, thatched cottage, they all walked down
to the beach in the direction pointed out by
Miss Edith.</p>

<p>The cobble-stones were rounded and smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
like paper-weights, and moved beneath their
feet with every step. Molly was obliged to
support her little brother very carefully to prevent
his stumbling, and he dragged so heavily
upon her arm that she reached the pool
quite fatigued.</p>

<p>Once there, divested of shoes and stockings,
and with his sailor trousers rolled above the
knee, Donald skipped about in the shoal
water, laughing and screaming at the top of his
little lungs.</p>

<p>“It’s ’most as good as bavin’,” he called to
Weezy. “Come wade wiv me!”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon,” replied Weezy, seating herself
upon the rough ledge that separated the
pool from the ocean, and beginning to unbutton
her boots.</p>

<p>At the second button her hand was arrested
by a shout from the summit of the cliff that
rose abruptly at her side. It was Kirke’s
voice, as clear and shrill as a trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Come up here, all of you! Come up and
see the ruins!”</p>

<p>Pauline sprang in haste from her perch on a
rock, crying,—</p>

<p>“We’ll do it, Molly, won’t we? I’m on
tiptoe for it.”</p>

<p>All the morning she had been longing to
explore this ancient Roman fortress, of which
the boys had talked the night before. Her
imagination had been revelling in its half-buried
donjon, its secret passages and its mouldering
lookout, from which, according to Kirke’s extravagant
statement, they could “almost see the
north pole.”</p>

<p>And now was the very time to visit the old
gray walls; yes, the very time, for her father
and Paul and Kirke were wandering up there
photographing the ruins, and could help Molly
and herself over the risky places. It was a
damper to her enthusiasm when Molly sorrowfully
replied,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“You and Weezy can go, Polly, but I can’t;
I can’t leave Donald.”</p>

<p>“There’d be no fun without you, Molly.”
Pauline made a wry face. “Can’t we take
Donald up with us?”</p>

<p>“Not peaceably, I’m afraid,” whispered
Molly with a sage smile. “Certainly not just
yet.”</p>

<p>“Supposing he <i>should</i> cry a little; that
wouldn’t hurt him,” persisted Pauline, hard-hearted
in her eagerness.</p>

<p>Molly flushed an indignant crimson. “I’m
not going to drag my little brother out of the
water for anybody,” she retorted quickly. “I
think ’twould be a burning shame, when he
loves it so and has hardly been in it two
seconds.”</p>

<p>Donald entertained the same opinion, and
when Pauline essayed by sweet words to coax
him upon dry land, he retreated with all speed
to the middle of the pool. This, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
scarcely nine feet across and but four inches
in depth, was an ocean to him; and from its
secure centre he shook his wilful little head
at his would-be captor.</p>

<p>His sisters smiled indulgently; but Pauline
betrayed an impatience that wounded Molly.</p>

<p>“I want to see the ruins as much as Polly
does,” she reflected; “but I won’t cheat Donald
of his little rights.”</p>

<p>Then a bright idea occurred to her. “I’ve
a great mind, Pauline, to ask Kirke to come
down here and stay with Donny while we
go up there.”</p>

<p>And she bent her neck backward to gaze
to the top of the dizzy height. Upon the
side where they stood and also upon the side
fronting the ocean the cliff was almost perpendicular.</p>

<p>“Oh, do ask him!” returned Pauline. “He
and Paul have been through the fortress twice,
and we haven’t seen so much as the shed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>“<i>I’d</i> scream to him and ask him, Molly,”
said Weezy, ever free with advice.</p>

<p>“Come up—to see—the ru-ins!” repeated
Kirke on a higher key, wondering why they
vouchsafed no reply.</p>

<p>“Answer him, Molly, do, or he’ll crack the
ears of France,” cried Pauline at her elbow.</p>

<p>Molly laughed.</p>

<p>“Take pity on me, Miss Ready-wit, and
stop being so funny,” she entreated, proceeding
to make a speaking-tube of her hands,
and calling energetically to Kirke, “Will you—come
down—to look out—for Donald?”</p>

<p>Though sweet and full, her tones were not
very strong. “<i>Look out</i>” was all that Kirke
could distinguish of her sentence. “Can’t
hear,” he vociferated; “speak louder.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go—if you’ll—<i>look out</i>—for <i>Don</i>!”
shouted Molly explosively, nearly splitting her
throat. “<i>Will you</i> do it?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will! Come right along!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
thundered Kirke, who had caught a word here
and a word there and had “jumped” at his
sister’s meaning. She wanted him to go with
her to the Lookout, that tumble-down tower
overlooking the sea. He was sure that was
what she wished, for she was always turning
giddy in high places and clinging to him,
afraid to take a step by herself.</p>

<p>So, not to vex her with needless questions,
Kirke simply waved his hand to put an end
to the talk, and went back to the lofty tower
to mount anew the broken steps within; for
he wanted to decide how far up it would
be safe for Molly and Pauline and Weezy to
climb.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the girls below expected at any
moment to see him descending the winding
path that led from the chalk cliffs to the fishing
village. When he failed to appear, Pauline
bethought herself of the secret passages she
had heard of. Probably he had chosen one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
of these to shorten the distance. Why, of
course he had, and there was no knowing
just where he would come out.</p>

<p>“He must be here soon, Molly,” said Pauline
impatiently, “and it’s getting hotter and
hotter. Why can’t we be going on slowly?”</p>

<p>“Will you keep Donald happy till Kirke
gets here, darling?” asked Molly, smiling at
her sister. “If you will, I’ll give you a
nickel.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you another, and that’ll be a
dime,” added Pauline.</p>

<p>Weezy gladly consented to the bargain.
She was filling a scrap-book with paper flags
of all nations, and a dime would purchase
several of these.</p>

<p>“You can run to overtake us, you know,
Weezy, as soon as Kirke comes,” called Molly
from the entrance of the path. “Tell him
not to let Donald wade too long.”</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” screamed Weezy, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
two girls passed from her view behind a
bend in the hill.</p>

<p>At their last glimpse of Donald, he was
standing outside the pool with Weezy, looking
at some peasant women who were washing
at the margin of the beach. The women
were kneeling with their backs to the children,
rubbing the clothes white upon the
smooth stones.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes may have elapsed, and
Pauline and Molly were approaching the dry
moat, that half surrounded the hoary fortress,
when they were startled by piercing shrieks
from Weezy, following one another in quick
succession.</p>

<p>Shrieking in their turn to Captain Bradstreet
and Paul above them, they rushed
madly down the descent, and as they drew near
the foot, met Weezy herself, sobbing wildly,—</p>

<p>“Donald’s drownded. I know he’s
drownded.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>And choking with grief and terror, she
faltered out her pitiful story:—</p>

<p>Tired of waiting for Kirke, she had left
Donald for “just a teeny second,” and
skipped away to look at the kneeling washer-women.
On her return the child had vanished,
and his little blue sailor-suit lay in a
tumbled heap upon the brink of the pool.</p>

<p>“Donny had been teasing again to go in
bathing, and I wouldn’t let him go,” wailed
his despairing little sister; “so I s’pect when
I wasn’t there he skipped into the ocean all
alone by himself. Donald, Don-<i>ald</i>, <i>where</i>
are you? Oh, dear, dear. I wish I was
dead!”</p>

<p>“Run to the inn, Weezy, for papa and
mamma; run as fast as you can,” cried
Molly, in a husky voice.</p>

<p>The sympathetic peasant women, having
discovered the cause of the outcry, had deserted
their washings and clattered in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
hob-nailed shoes toward the base of the cliff,
near the tell-tale garments. Here the water
was deeper than on the beach in front of
the boat-house, and it dashed over a ledge
worn into many chambers. The peasants
were pointing to these deep chambers with
gloomy looks, and muttering low to one
another, when Mr. and Mrs. Rowe and Weezy
came flying from the inn, and met Captain
Bradstreet and the boys upon the shore.</p>

<p>Though pale with anguish, Mrs. Rowe had
shed no tears. But when her eyes fell upon
the little empty sailor-suit, she gathered it in
her arms with the bitter cry, “O Donald,
my little Donald, come back to your poor
mamma!”</p>

<p>Then it was that something unexpected
happened—something which changed her
mourning into gladness. A little golden head
shot suddenly up from behind a neighboring
rock, and a shrill little voice cried out,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
“Here I is, mamma. Oh, please come
qui-ck.”</p>

<p>Everybody jumped as if an earthquake had
swallowed the cliff.</p>

<p>“It’s Donald, it’s Donald! I didn’t drown
him at all!” shouted Weezy, dancing up and
down in frantic joy.</p>

<p>Her mother had rushed behind the sheltering
rock to embrace her lost baby.</p>

<p>“Oh, my sweet, cold darling,” she cried,
pressing the wet child to her breast; “how
could you frighten mamma so?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t mean to, truly. Was only just
a-bavin’,”—here disobedient Donald hung his
head,—“and Weezy comed back, and then I
runned and hid,—just for fun, mamma!”</p>

<p>“But after that, Donald dear, you heard
people call to you. Why didn’t you answer
them and tell them where you were?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i149">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i149.jpg" alt="Here I is, Mamma">

<p class="right"><i>Page <a href="#Page_142">142</a></i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Donald snuggled closer to his mother’s
breast. “I hadn’t a bit o’ clo’es on, mamma,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
don’t you know?” he whispered; “not a single
bit o’ clo’es on! S’pose I wanted the queer
old womens to see?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowe answered him with a kiss. And
when she had hurried on his dry garments,
she yielded him up to his father and the rest
of the family to be loved and petted, as if he
had been a very good instead of a very mischievous
little fellow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>WHAT STRANGE COUNTRIES!</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, isn’t it nice, Molly, that we’re all
going to <i>Ruin</i>?” exclaimed Weezy, giving her
sister’s hand an ecstatic squeeze under the
table.</p>

<p>They were breakfasting again at Hotel Frascati,
their party having returned the night before
to Havre.</p>

<p>“Don’t say <i>Ruin</i>, Weezybus! You mix it
up with the other ruins; but it’s a city, and
it’s called Rouen,” corrected laughing Molly,
ending the name with a nasal flourish.</p>

<p>“How silly! I should think they’d know
better!” retorted the young American critic.
But at the approach of a waiter she immediately
became mute. She had a private conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that these black-coated individuals must
comprehend English, they looked so wise.</p>

<p>On leaving the dining-room, Weezy and
her friends passed out into the spacious vestibule,
and there waited for the carriage which
was to convey them to the station. Jane Leonard
was with the others, free from headache and
keeping a strict watch over frisky little Donald.</p>

<p>As they stood at the foot of the long staircase,
the hotel servants—<i>concierge</i>, <i>garçons</i>,
maids in white caps and all—crowded
around them.</p>

<p>“They’re sorry we’re going away, aren’t
they, Molly? Just as sorry as they can be,”
whispered gratified Weezy.</p>

<p>“There, you’re mistaken, little miss,”
said Paul, who had overheard the remark.
“They’re only hanging around for a fee.”</p>

<p>“What is a fee, Molly?” questioned Weezy
aside.</p>

<p>“Money paid for work, dear. See, papa is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
taking out his purse, so is Captain Bradstreet;
they’re going to give some French coins to
the servants.”</p>

<p>“To get the servants to move out of the
way,” interposed Paul archly. “They’ll
hand each of them a small sum to
make them ‘move on,’ as you do to organ-grinders.”</p>

<p>Here the carriage drove up, and the party
hastened to catch the train for Rouen. The
train was composed of several small black
cars or coaches, which Kirke declared looked
like a row of Saratoga trunks in mourning.
Each coach was divided widthwise into compartments,
having on either side a door with
a sliding glass panel at the top.</p>

<p>Captain Bradstreet was fortunate enough
to secure a vacant compartment which would
just accommodate the party, and The Happy
Six were soon quietly ensconced in the front
seat with their backs toward the engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Miss Evans sat opposite Paul and gazed
abstractedly out of the window, hardly lifting
her eyes from the trim green hedge that
bordered the railway track. Once—they
were then near Rouen—he saw her start
nervously and press her hand to her left
side, as if to assure herself that the reticule
was in its place.</p>

<p>“How she does clutch that old bag,” he
whispered in Kirke’s ear, as they stopped at
the station. “Probably the conductor takes
her for a mail-carrier.”</p>

<p>“Rouen is a famous old city, Molly; I
hope you’ll learn all you can about it,” said
Mr. Rowe wearily, as they alighted at the
hotel.</p>

<p>He had not recovered yet from the fatiguing
sea voyage, and as soon as they had
engaged their rooms at Hotel d’Angleterre,
he went to lie down.</p>

<p>When shown to their own apartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Molly and Pauline exclaimed at the number
of looking-glasses it contained. Even the
upper halves of the windows were mirrors;
and in trying to gaze out upon the river
Seine, Pauline was surprised to see only her
own face.</p>

<p>“They want to make the most of their
guests, I should say,” she remarked dryly,
after viewing herself in seven different
glasses.</p>

<p>“This might be called ‘the chamber
of reflection,’” she continued, arranging her
crimps.</p>

<p>“You’re too bright to live,” cried Molly.
“But put on your hat again, Miss Vanity.
Don’t you know we’re going to drive around
the city?”</p>

<p>“Who are going?”</p>

<p>“Only The Happy Six; that’s all.”</p>

<p>Their driver was an old man, intelligent
and fond of scenery. He took them first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
through some of the oldest streets of Rouen,
hardly six feet wide, where two teams could
not possibly pass each other. Perhaps it
may have been to warn away other drivers
that he cracked his whip so sharply,—“as
if he were killing an elephant,” Kirke whispered
to Paul.</p>

<p>Then they went to see the round tower
in which Joan of Arc spent so many tedious
months, in a cell only large enough to admit
a narrow window, yet with walls twelve feet
thick.</p>

<p>Thence they drove to the spot where she
was burned as a witch; and Molly stepped
from the carriage to read the inscription
carved upon the stone in the pavement.</p>

<p>“Oh, how wickedly they did treat that
innocent creature!” said she, with flashing
eyes. “You know she didn’t want to go
into battle; but she ‘went forth to save
France.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“And to crown Charles Seventh,” added
Pauline. “I detest him—the ungrateful
thing!”</p>

<p>It was some comfort to the indignant girls
to find towers and fountains and streets
named for Jeanne D’Arc, and one church
sacred to the wonderful maid, where mass
is said for soldiers. They came to that
in returning from St. Catharine’s Hill, from
which they had gazed down upon the
Seine.</p>

<p>“What a tiny river,” said Kirke; “no
wider than a New England brook!”</p>

<p>It mattered little to them that Corneille
was born at Rouen, and that William the
Conqueror died there. Their interest in the
history of the city was centred in the trial
and martyrdom of Joan the Maid.</p>

<p>Their next resting-place was Mantes, at
an old hotel built around an open court—the
very court, so Pauline was told, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
William the Conqueror received his deathblow,
falling from his horse.</p>

<p>“But I’m thankful to say William didn’t
die here,” said the lively girl, tilting her
nose. “They carried him to an abbey at
Rouen, where I <i>hope</i> ’twas cleaner!”</p>

<p>“But Mantes is an interesting city, anyway,”
returned Molly dreamily. “Just think,
Polly, it’s eight hundred years old!”</p>

<p>“Humph! not very forward for its age,”
sniffed Pauline. “Can’t even keep out of
the dirt! Mould and antiquity are all very
well for those that can afford ’em; as for
me, I’m satisfied with simple magnificence.”</p>

<p>She found “simple magnificence” a day or
two after at the Palace of Versailles, in the
Glass Saloon, a ball-room lined with mirrors.</p>

<p>“Yankee Molly, can you believe your ears?
The guide-book says this is where Queen
Victoria once opened the ball with Napoleon
Third!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>And Pauline danced airily across the floor,
by way of illustration.</p>

<p>“I hope the queen did it as gracefully as
that,” replied Molly admiringly. “But oh,
Pauline, you haven’t seen the splendid ‘Court
of Marble!’ I can show you the balcony
above it that poor Marie Antoinette stepped
out upon when she tried so hard to pacify
that howling mob.”</p>

<p>“More than a hundred years ago that was,
wasn’t it, Molly?” said Pauline, following her.
“It makes me feel dreadfully modern, like an
hour-old mosquito.”</p>

<p>After looking through the famous picture
gallery, which so fully illustrates the history
of France, the tourists proceeded to Grand
Trianon, the palace built by Louis XIV. for
Madame de Maintenon. The apartments are
all on one floor.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the madame was clumsy and
didn’t like to climb stairs,” suggested Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Paul and Kirke were delighted with the
private rooms of Napoleon First, and with
his gorgeous nuptial carriage seen afterwards
at the Royal Stables.</p>

<p>But Grand Trianon did not interest any of
them as much as did Little Trianon, quarter
of a mile away. This is a bewitching toy
hamlet in excellent preservation. Here stands
the quaint old mill where Louis XVI. played
at being miller, and the rustic dairy where his
queen, the ill-fated Marie Antoinette, made
butter with her own royal hands; and there
are modest little houses grouped around the
water, like our summer cottages in America.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad that poor old king and
queen had a little fun before they lost their
heads?” said Paul.</p>

<p>“If they hadn’t lost their heads first,
though, they never would have dared risk so
much fun,” flashed back his sister.</p>

<p>“There seems to have been no end to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
extravagance of the French court in those
days. No wonder the people were incensed,”
remarked Mr. Rowe, as they entered
the carriage which was to take them to Paris.</p>

<p>Halfway to the city they paused at the
beautiful village of St. Cloud to visit the celebrated
park that had once contained a palace,—the
favorite resort of royalty.</p>

<p>“Think of the Germans burning it in the
late war. What good did that do them?”
cried the boys indignantly.</p>

<p>“They’re dangerous people, those Germans,
always making a smoke,” said Pauline,
dismissing the topic at the entrance of the
Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>For miles the road lay through this beautiful
forest, no longer as of old haunted by
robbers, but now a fashionable park. It was
a lovely drive, one never to be forgotten.
Even Weezy and Donald were quiet, too fascinated
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>It was late in the afternoon when the Silver
Gate tourists arrived in “the most beautiful
city in the world.” On all sides were life
and gayety. Everywhere as they passed
were little tables along the pavement, and
people seated around them eating their
suppers and chatting in high, good humor.
Weezy wondered aloud if they “ever drank
tea in their houses?” Captain Bradstreet
said, “Yes, when it rained.”</p>

<p>The carriage left our party at an immense
hotel, The Continental, which with its six
or seven hundred rooms was quite a city in
itself.</p>

<p>Here Miss Evans was met by her uncle,
and she regretfully took leave of her kind
friends. Mrs. Rowe’s last words to her
were:—</p>

<p>“If you don’t succeed with your errand in
Paris as you wish, I hope you’ll try London.
You remember we are to leave here in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
fortnight. When our route is decided upon,
I’ll write you. We should be delighted to
have you for a travelling companion again.”</p>

<p>As The Happy Six met next morning in
the court, Paul announced,—</p>

<p>“The picture galleries and shops and everything
will be closed to-day.”</p>

<p>“What for, Twinny dear?” asked his sister
in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p>“It’s the Fourteenth of July, Better-half,
the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille.
The French call this their Independence
Day, so our <i>garçon</i> says. Something like
our Fourth of July, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Don’t <i>they</i> have Fourths of Julys?” put
in Weezy. “What funny, funny folks!”</p>

<p>“Their Fourteenth seems to be Memorial
Day and Fourth of July in one,” replied
Paul. “Kirke and I are going to <i>Père la
Chaise</i> this forenoon to see them decorate
their soldiers’ graves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>As the boys approached this cemetery, the
finest in the city, they found the streets on
every side filled with dealers in crosses and
relics and immortelles; and these sombre
tokens which were afterwards placed so tenderly
above the sleeping dead were really
hideous things.</p>

<p>“Not a single flower or green leaf in them,
Molly,” said Kirke, on their return, “nothing
but wire and tinsel and glass.”</p>

<p>But after their mourning duty was performed,
the Parisians had a festive time for
the rest of the day, dancing on the streets in the
evening,—old men and old women, young men
and young women, and babies and all.</p>

<p>The whole fortnight in Paris was a giddy
whirl of delight to The Happy Six. They
drove along the boulevards in <i>fiacres</i>, or on
the tops of omnibuses. They sailed in pleasure
boats on the Seine. They visited churches,
palaces, and the tomb of Napoleon. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
even ascended to the dizzy summit of the
Eiffel Tower which Weezy said “reached ’most
to heaven.”</p>

<p>Of all the days Donald preferred the last,
at the Gardens of Acclimatization. Here he
saw animals from every zone, and actually
was carried on an ostrich’s back.</p>

<p>The children would all have liked a longer
time in the beautiful white city, but Mr.
Rowe was in haste to reach the baths of
Baden Baden.</p>

<p>On the morning of their departure the
Silver Gate people were joined at the railroad
station by Miss Evans, who shook hands
with them all very cordially.</p>

<p>“You perceive I’ve accepted your kind
invitation and am going on to London with
you,” she said to Mrs. Rowe.</p>

<p>And, tapping her reticule with her gloved
finger, she added a few words, inaudible to
the rest.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">See</span>, she’s tacked on that everlasting bag
again, Molly,” whispered Pauline, as the train
started. “It always reminds me of a great
tag on a little parcel, as if Miss Evans had
been done up to be sent by express.”</p>

<p>That night they reached Besançon, an old
Roman city just under the wall of the Jura
Mountains. The hotel at which they stopped
was very curious, with sleeping-rooms tucked
away here and there, like swallows’ nests in
a bank. Sometimes these rooms were entered
from within the house, sometimes from without,
by sly, crooked stairways.</p>

<p>Molly and Pauline could see no beds in
their apartment, and ran after the porter to
ask him where they were to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>He smiled rather patronizingly, and threw
open some unsuspected doors in the partition,
which had been concealed by the flowery
wall-paper. Inside were two single bedsteads,
with maroon curtains of damask, and on each
bed was the usual little down quilt called a
<i>duvet</i>, which had an inconvenient habit of
crawling off upon the floor whenever the occupant
of the bed turned over.</p>

<p>Altogether the hotel was very quaint, and
so completely surrounded by tall buildings
that it rarely saw the sun.</p>

<p>“Papa says the house is centuries old,” said
Molly, throwing up their narrow window.</p>

<p>“Well, we might have known it,” replied the
ready Pauline. “We might have known it was
built in the dark ages by the lack of light in it.”</p>

<p>“Papa says Victor Hugo was born in this
city,” returned Molly. “We’re all going by
and by to see his old house, and we’ll photograph
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Next day the party drove in carriages
through the lovely valley of the Loire to the
bewitching little village of Mouthier, where
there are no streets to mention, the houses
being scattered around in clusters, “as if,” as
Kirke said, they had been “shaken out of a
pepper-box.”</p>

<p>Here they visited a cheese-factory, in what
had once been a convent, and they declared
they should never want any more French
cheese; but they forgot this afterward.</p>

<p>To tell of all their travelling experiences
would weary you. How they drove through
tunnels and around the brink of precipices,
to see the Loire rush out from its mountain
cave a full-grown river.</p>

<p>How in Switzerland they climbed the Alps
on wise-looking little donkeys, took a peep at
the yellow stone city of Neuchâtel, once peopled
by the Lake-dwellers, and looked down
into the bear-pits of Berne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>How in Germany they spent weeks in Baden
Baden, and Mr. Rowe was benefited by
the mud-baths, which in Weezy’s opinion
were not at all clean.</p>

<p>How in approaching Cologne they passed
vast grain-fields, where the wheat had been
reaped and stacked into piles shaped like
little woodsheds.</p>

<p>How in Cologne they spent much time in
its cathedral,—the finest Gothic cathedral in
the world. Paul and Molly never tired of
gazing at its graceful arches, its clustered columns
and beautiful pictured windows of
stained glass.</p>

<p>Kirke and Pauline, however, were more fascinated
by the scene in front of their hotel,
the Victoria.</p>

<p>It chanced to be market morning, and the
peasant women had flocked into the city before
sunrise, pushing before them hand-carts
filled with fruit and vegetables. Large dogs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
were harnessed underneath many of these
carts, and trotted contentedly with their burdens
to the open square, where they either
lay down to rest, or stood howling and barking
by fifties, while their mistresses chattered
and laughed, and spread out their wares to
attract customers.</p>

<p>It was while still in Germany that the
Americans took a carriage-drive along the
banks of the Rhine to visit a grim, feudal
castle covered with ivy and surrounded by a
moat. The castle was the residence of an
absent count, and was kept open by servants,
who, for a small fee, would show the interior
to visitors.</p>

<p>“What a lovely, mouldy old place!” exclaimed
Pauline, when the horses had stopped before
it. And springing to the ground she hastened
into the court, across what formerly had been
a drawbridge.</p>

<p>Miss Evans followed more slowly, pausing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
midway to peep over the rail down into the
sluggish water of the moat beneath her.
Owing to a vegetable growth upon its surface,
this water was as green and velvety as
a meadow.</p>

<p>“I should think that pasture-y look would
fool near-sighted cows, shouldn’t you, Miss
Evans?” said Kirke at her elbow; and he
was gratified that she positively laughed at
his nonsense. This made the second time
she had laughed that day. Entranced by the
beauty and antiquity of the spot, she ran
about the park with Weezy like a gay young
girl; stopped at the ponds to feed from her
own luncheon the gold-fish and swans; and
on returning to the castle waved her handkerchief
from its highest turret.</p>

<p>“She actually looks happy, Polly,” observed
Molly, answering the salute from the bridge
below.</p>

<p>“So she does. She must have forgotten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
herself,” responded Pauline with a touch of
sarcasm.</p>

<p>Pauline was right. Miss Evans <i>had</i> forgotten
herself, and for this reason something
very sad had occurred—something which
little Miss Weezy was the first to recognize.</p>

<p>She sat opposite Miss Evans in the carriage,
and after they had driven several miles toward
Cologne suddenly exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Why, how funny, Miss Evans! You
haven’t brought your reticule!”</p>

<p>The young lady flashed a glance at her
belt and threw up both hands with a cry.</p>

<p>“What shall I do? What shall I do? I’ve
lost my bag! I had it when we started, and
now it is gone!”</p>

<p>“Edward,” exclaimed Mrs. Rowe to her
husband, “please ask the coachman to turn
the carriage about. We must drive back for
the reticule at once. I’ve told you of its
valuable contents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Family heirlooms probably,” reflected Captain
Bradstreet. “What was the girl thinking
of to carry such trinkets about her person?”</p>

<p>“Do you recollect where you last saw the
reticule, Miss Evans?” asked Mr. Rowe, when
the horses were retracing their steps.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t remember, Mr. Rowe!” Miss
Evans’s face was ghastly white. “I haven’t
the remotest idea. How could I—how could
I have forgotten that reticule for one moment?”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Miss Evans; we’ll find it
for you,” called Kirke from his seat beside
the coachman. “Paul and I will find it for
you, if we kill ourselves running.”</p>

<p>But though the boys hunted diligently, and
the whole party aided in the quest, twilight
fell, and the reticule had not been discovered.</p>

<p>They had searched the highway leading
to the castle; had searched the castle itself,
and questioned the apple-cheeked serving-maid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> 
who had just shown them its interior;
had searched the park, and even the ponds
within it; and at last had met in despair
upon the bridge that spanned the moat.</p>

<p>“I think I must have dropped my reticule
into this water when I leaned over the rail
here this afternoon,” said Miss Evans, her
voice quivering. “In that case, the manuscript
would be spoiled before now.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take another look for it in the park;
it’s lighter there,” whispered Kirke to Paul;
from no expectation of finding the coveted
object where it had been so patiently sought,
but from a strong desire to get out of the
way before Miss Evans began to cry. Like
boys in general, he had a great aversion to
seeing a woman in tears.</p>

<p>“Have you a copy of the book, Miss
Evans?” asked Mrs. Rowe, as the boys
were walking away unobserved.</p>

<p>“Not one line, Mrs. Rowe. My father, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
mistake, destroyed the rough draft when he
was burning up old papers.”</p>

<p>“I pity you with all my heart, dear
friend,” said Mrs. Rowe, deeply moved.
“But don’t be discouraged. It is too dark
to look longer now, but we will come back
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“O Mrs. Rowe, if I had only listened to
you, and sent it by express!” wailed Miss
Evans. “But I had too much sentiment.
That book was my father’s life-work, and I
couldn’t bear to trust it out of my sight.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry for you, Miss Evans,” observed
Captain Bradstreet, adding mentally,
“sorry, too, that you should have been so
foolish.”</p>

<p>“It is too dreadful!” The young lady
could no longer restrain her tears. “O
Captain Bradstreet, to think that the precious
manuscript should have been lost by me,
papa’s own daughter!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Evans had failed to make satisfactory
arrangement for bringing out the book
in Paris, Captain Bradstreet,” explained Mrs.
Rowe. “Consequently, she was taking it to
publishers in London.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sad loss, a sad loss,” returned the
captain, as he helped the ladies into the carriage.
“But where are the rest of us?” he
added. “We can’t leave our boys.”</p>

<p>“They’re coming, they’re running like
everything,” cried Weezy, standing upon the
wagon-seat to look. “Kirke is holding something
up high, and shaking it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bag!” shouted Molly, clapping her
hands. “I do believe it’s Miss Evans’s bag!”</p>

<p>“I’ve found it! Found it just outside the
park,” yelled Kirke, when within hearing distance.
“It’s all right. The dew hasn’t
hurt it!”</p>

<p>It seems that in leaving the park Kirke
had seen the glitter of steel under the luxuriant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
ivy at its entrance, and stooping to
brush aside the vines, had touched the clasp
of the lost reticule.</p>

<p>“I suppose the chain caught upon the
fence when you squeezed through that narrow
gap, Miss Evans,” said he, in winding
up his story.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Evans, it must have caught
and twitched your bag off so quickly that
you didn’t know it,” added Paul, as the carriage
rolled on; “and then the bag fell into
that tangle of leaves where nobody noticed
it but Kirke. His eyes are as sharp as a
razor.”</p>

<p>“Fortunately for me, Paul!” Miss Evans
was half-laughing, half-crying. “O Kirke, I
can’t be grateful enough to you for bringing
this back to me!”</p>

<p>Kirke blushed with pleasure, and Paul felt
a momentary pang of regret that he had not
discovered the valued article himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>He looked on with interest as Miss Evans
drew from the alligator-skin bag a parcel
neatly encased in oiled silk. It was her
father’s manuscript, written in a fine clear
hand, upon very thin commercial paper.</p>

<p>“Untouched, uninjured! This is more than
I deserve!” she exclaimed joyfully.</p>

<p>“Good! Three cheers for the finder!
Nine cheers for the owner!” cried Paul,
swinging his cap.</p>

<p>And The Happy Six joined in a gay
hurrah.</p>

<p>We might follow the glad children over
Europe and back again to their sunny home
on the Pacific; but perhaps it is better to
leave them right here, for then we end the
book as we began it, with a chorus of children
giving three cheers.</p>
